Isil, an Inyxx Warrior   64434
Once an ordinary warrior, Isil has been favoured by Inyxx to be the
guardian of the Altar of Rage.  His sable hair frames his face in
curling tendrils, almost blending into the ebony of his skin.  His eyes
glow green with an inner light, the true sign he has been touched by his
God.

Xtacth, the Inyxx Warrior   81969
Xtacth's skin is ebony black, far darker than you have seen in a human
before.  He is completely bald, you cannot even see eyebrows or
eyelashes.  His figure is heavily muscled, and he moves with the silent
grace of a panther.  His eyes transfix you, glowing a malicious green.

Talon, the Inyxx Warrior   62339
Talon was once a human thief, who knew the fear of those who must live
in the cesspits of humanity.  When Inyxx touched his soul, he answered
the call gladly.  He now serves as the Guardian of the Altar of Fear,
spreading the black song of Inyxx's debilitating fear.  His luminous
green eyes are the sure sign of the favour of Inyxx.

Sharii, an Inyxx Warrior  78704
Sharii's small frame almost seems to hum with life.  Her lithe, athletic
form is never still as she paces the room, not from nervousness, but
from sheer energy.  Her hair is flame red, but the part closest to her
head is nearly black, as though the blackness of her heart is leeching
into it.  Her eyes glow with a vile green radiance.  She was once a
wife, and a mother, before her entire family was killed by a band of
marauders.  It was then she heard the siren call of Inyxx, to serve and
never suffer that despair again.

The Avatar of Despair   86265
This is the living embodiment of Despair.  Its form is almost
transparent, making its features hard to ascertain.  It is vaguely
humanoid, though its body is shrouded by a cloak-like garment that is as
transparent as the rest of its form.  Its face is the most chilling of
all.  As you watch its features, you are sure you recognize your father,
until they shift into the features of your mother, then to your best
childhood friend.  The face shifts between all the faces you know and
love, but every single face bears an expression of unbelievable sadness,
the eyes filled with the utter blackness of despair.

The Avatar of Fear   78125
This is the living embodiment of Fear.  At first it simply appears to be
a mass of shadows, through which various shapes flicker in the darkness
that is the Avatar.  Looking closer, you see the shapes of your family,
your friends, your loved ones, being tortured horribly by undefined yet
terrifying shapes.  You see the things you care most about being torn
down and trod into the earth, desecrated and destroyed.  The shapes
dance madly in wild contortions, following out their sickening motions
until you feel physically ill.

The Avatar of Hatred   77638
This is the living embodiment of Hatred.  It has no definite form,
shifting constantly between a bristling mass of swords to a cloud of
chill darkness, and everything in between.  It radiates a miasma of cold
hatred.

The Avatar of Rage   60401
This is the living embodiment of Rage.  It resembles a ravening beast,
although its form constantly shifts.  Bony spikes push through its skin,
until they disappear again moments later.  Its mouth grows teeth and
absorbs them as its feet grow and retract claws.  The constant change of
its form is almost dizzying, and is certainly terrifying.

Inyxx, the Demon of Darkness   243560
Inyxx stands about 12 feet tall.  His naked torso is heavily muscled,
disappearing into loose-fitting black pants which mask his nether
regions.  His skin is jet black, and he has no hair on his body that you
can see.  Two large bull-horns sprout from his head, shining as if they
were made of polished ebony.  His features are large and prominent,
reminding you somewhat of a bull.  His eyes glow an eerie green, with
bottomless pupils the colour of night.

An inyxx sword
This slender sword is made of a material that looks much like black ice,
but the surface has a metallic sheen.  It appears to be one solid piece,
although it is as exquisitely formed as the work of the finest
blacksmith.  The edges of the sword are razor sharp, and the hilt fits
easily in your hand.

An inyxx wand
This slender wand is made of a material that seems to be black ice,
though it shows no sign of melting.  The surface has a strange
iridescent sheen to it, but the wand shows no other signs of doing
anything worthwhile.

An inyxx potion
This little black bottle is full of a black liquid that is as dark as
the night.  There doesn't appear to be any way to get the liquid out of
the bottle, however.

A suit of inyxx armour
This armour is made of a substance very like black ice, although it
shows no signs of melting.  The armour seems strangely dead, as though
something else were required to make it come alive.

The Armour of Despair
This armour is made of a substance very like black ice, although it
shows no signs of melting.  The crystalline armour seems transparent,
but instead of seeing through the black ice, you seem to see a great
dark depth.  Looking into those depths, you get the feeling that
something will come into view if you watch a minute longer...and you are
sure you don't want to see what that something is.

A lump of inyxx
This small lump of inyxx is remarkably spherical.  It is a
clear black, but deep in its heart burns a green flame.

Inyxx Marble
Exquisitely crafted/magicked, this pristine little inyxx bauble is the
whimsical, residual aftermath of peeronic thought.  Sadly, the entropic
tendencies of such mental energies are difficult to grasp or maintain.
A marble will inevitably evanesce and reform in an infinite number of
cryptic locations.  Deep in the heart of the clear black marble burns a
green flame.
