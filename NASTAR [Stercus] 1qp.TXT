3: search paperwork, wear spectacles
4: switch on lamp, look at light, get sphere

Clerk of NASTAR   4187
This uniformed man sits behind a large desk. He has monitors of the
entire building in front of him. He seems apathetic and ignores you.

4-Armed Guard    26415
This man looks normal in every way except for the fact that he has two
mechanical metal arms surgically attached to his torso. You wonder why
someone bothered to spend so much money on such an intricate
procedure.

A Mean Janitor (mean)    11615
This is the mean old janitor who cleans the NASTAR building. He is
sooo NASTY! You hate him. You want to kill him. Go ahead! Kill him!
Make this place happier for everyone.

Video-Camera    6124
This is a very high-tech video camera, with laser beam cannons mounted
beneath it. It does not look very tough, but would probably blow the
hell out of you if you tried to actually destroy it.

Robotic sparring partner     7150
It looks like this is what the guards use to practice their moves on.
It can take a hell of a beating.

Fighting Master     24632
This is the man who trains all the guards who work for Mr. Swain. He
trains them in both body and mind. He looks like he knows what he is
doing.

5-Armed Guard   43400
This man looks normal in every way except for the fact that he has
three mechanical metal arms surgically attached to his torso. You
wonder why someone bothered to spend so much money on such an
intricate procedure.

Mainframe    30167
This computer is huge. While it is made mostly of silicon, glass, and
plastic, it seems to be alive. Perhaps this is the source of all the
wealth of this NASTAR corporation. Artificial intelligence.

Mr. Swain - unkillable
This is Mr. Swain. He is the sole owner NASTAR inc. He is very
wealthy, and very powerful. Like a Bill Gates who could kick your ass.
You probably should just do what he tells you.
say hi, yes, sure






Robotic arm (enchanted)
This mechanical arm, used by the guards in NASTAR can be wielded as a
weapon.  It seems to have a mind of its own.

Silicon armour
This armour is made from the same stuff that they put in computers.
Cheap, but effective.

A Pair of Spectacles (worn)
An electronic pair of grey spectacles, with the logo 'Photech'
and the inscription 'ultraviolet sensors 9400' on them. They look
extremely expensive and high-tech.

A note
A note with writing on it. Perhaps you could read it.
read note
Thank you for killing this clerk. He was lazy but
kind, and I did not have the heart to fire him.
Since you are here, I assume you are looking for work.
If I am right, please proceed to the 5th floor, and
meet me in the big office room. I will fill you in on
the details when you get here.

Just come on in and say 'hi'


                   Signed,
                          Mr. Swain.
