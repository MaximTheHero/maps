Troll
This massive beast stands approximately eight feet tall.  Yellowish
drool cascades down its ever-gaping maw.  Its skin is mottled green,
with warts and pockmarks randomly dispersed about its torso.
Two piercing claws extend from its grotesque arms.  A dull, hollow
stare indicates little intelligence; but an insatiable desire to
to devour flesh.



Pile of Ashes
These are the remains of a disintegrated troll.  It's not really something
you would find useful.  You might as well just scatter them with a kick
of your foot.

Healing scroll
This is a yellowed roll of parchment.  A quick examination of it
reveals this to be a healing scroll.  You can heal yourself by
typing 'heal' or heal another player by typing 'heal <player>'.
