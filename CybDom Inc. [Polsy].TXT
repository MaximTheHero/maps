A cyberized guard    7752
This guard stands before you, blocking your way into the main building.  He
wields a sharp humming blade, obviously mechanized in some way.  His cyber
body gleams powerfully in the light and you hear various whirrings from
inside it.  He looks like he likes his job.

A Cybernetic Leader     33058
You see a powerful cyber before you.  His body has been substantially
upgraded, most particularly a nasty-looking particle cannon attached to his
arm.  He seems intelligent, certainly considerably more so than the guard
outside.  From all this, you judge him to be the leader of this operation.



Humming knife
This warm, short knife hums gently in your hand as you hold it.  It seems
to have its own self-contained power supply, which causes the blade to
vibrate rapidly.  It's a pretty sharp knife as it is, but the vibrating
blade could cut deeply.

Particle cannon
This lethal-looking cannon straps neatly onto your arm, ready for firing
straight away.  The built-in power supply ensures that it'll never fail to
deliver that killing blast.
