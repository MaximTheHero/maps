The dust beneath your feet is grey and calm...more still than
the corpse of a brown flower.  It looks up at you as the flower
and tells you to tease it...to swish it around with your feet
and tussle it between your toes.

The set of giant panels before you presents a live and
autochthonous view of life in the warehouse.  To the
right, there is a panel that is torn and ripped, defiled by
time and what the sun knows as its lifelong companion.
To the right (and therefore left) of this imperfect panel
is another panel, this one brilliant and untouched, a
symbol of perfection more lunar and suave than anything else
in the warehouse.  Particles swirl around and sniff you.

The tensions around you are maddening, forcing your body into
mild thought and distilled pensiveness.  The translucent hues
of brown and a pale green filter through your nostrils as you
see the scent of burning lumber.

Beneath a dark ceiling of flesh waiteth you, surrounded by
these brooding maroon caverns that conduct their own experi-
ments upon themselves, daring you to conduct your own.  The
lines of your own figure are blurred here, and strange shapes
around you shiver as if discontent with your eyes.

You encompass that which deceived you, the nail that
once was the shape of your friend.  You see the details on its
surface, the bumps that forever denote it as completely imperfect.

The face of your love, you will find, will forever be perfect.  
Things you previously considered flaws...things that in others 
you would detest...are now as dear to you as life itself.  Around
you lie the red expanses of love, the meatus of the throbbing 
heart that you once took for granted, but which now makes itself
known like nothing you have felt before.  Blood pulses around
you like tidal waves of energy as you stand within your lover's
existence.

The segmented windows beside you belong to the spectral warehouse
outside of which you now float.  Your consciousness is dragged 
involuntarily towards an unimaginably brilliant source of light
which, in the blue space above, sits in yellow splendor.  It is
said that he who touches the sun shall be he who survives the
impossible.  In your sensory-deprived state, there is no ground
below towards which to fall.  The gravity pulls you upwards.

*touch sun*

It is the manifestation of perfection before you, the heart of
your lover.  Blood enters and exits, flows and retracts, moves
everywhere in this cataclysm of creation.  Within the heart is 
the pure, the benevolent...the sacrifices that make you perfect.
The heart has experienced everything that can ever be endured,
it has conducted its own experiments and is fully something which
can never be without care or faith.

*for the one who brings forth from you the greatest sacrifice,
you must feel your love forever.  after forever completes its 
circle, what will be left but your love?  when the chair of the
domain cleaves your sight from your expectancies, what will be left
but that which, for your lover, you sacrificed?  now that you stand
inside the very heart of the thing you admire the most, there is
only one thing you can do...and you must do it briefly.  spare
no time as you glance about the love*
