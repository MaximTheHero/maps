The Queen of Hearts
The Queen of Hearts.  This is her garden.  She seems really grumpy and
is complaining about all sorts of non-existent flaws in her garden.
Be careful messing with her.

The <#> of Hearts
A gigantic playing card is standing here!  It is apparently wandering
through the Queen's garden.  It has <#> hearts emblazoned on its chest.

A Gardener
A little man in overalls.  He is hard at work.  He is futilely
attempting to fix every flaw in the garden before the Queen can
possibly imagine one.  He is dressed in brown overalls and has a
gardening tool in his hand.



Ring of Hearts

Gardening Shears
Standard gardening shears, really.  They have long metal handles with
green rubber grips on each end.  The cutting blades aren't sharp, it
cuts because of the distance between them.  You could use it as a
weapon but you would probably crush as often as you would cut someone.

Gardening Hoe {Rusty}
A standard gardening hoe.  It has a six foot long wooden handle with a
metal spade on one end.  The wood is worn down from use. It would be
unwieldy, but you could probably cause some damage with it, especially
with that particularly nasty rust that is all over it.
