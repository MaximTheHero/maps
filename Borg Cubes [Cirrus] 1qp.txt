Monsters:
A Small Borg   8945
The Borg is not physically imposing and is completely impassive. The
creaking of leather mixes with the subtle clicking and whirring of
mechanical parts which have been surgically integrated into the Borg's
body. The Borg will ignore you unless you are seen as a threat. Be
cautious about attacking: the Collective communicates with all Borgs
remembering the form of your attack and adapting its defense.

A Large Borg    12561
The Borg is physically imposing and completely impassive. The creaking
of leather mixes with the subtle clicking and whirring of mechanical
parts which have been surgically integrated into the Borg's body. The
Borg will ignore you unless you are seen as a threat. Be cautious about
attacking: the Collective communicates with all Borgs remembering the
form of your attack and adapting its defense.

A Huge Borg   35613
The Borg towers over you, it is strong and appears physically
threatening. The creaking of leather mixes with the subtle clicking and
whirring of mechanical parts which have been surgically integrated into
the Borg's body. The Borg will ignore you unless you are seen as a
threat. Be cautious about attacking: the Collective communicates with
all Borgs remembering the form of your attack and adapting its defense.

A Massive Borg   62611
The Borg is gigantic, standing huge and threatening before you, daring
you to take it on. The creaking of leather mixes with the subtle
clicking and whirring of mechanical parts which have been surgically
integrated into the Borg's body. The Borg will ignore you unless you are
seen as a threat. Be cautious about attacking: the Collective
communicates with all Borgs remembering the form of your attack and
adapting its defense.

A Strange Borg     8613
Something seems different about this Borg. Your eye is drawn to a
strange object it wears about its neck which hums and glows, pulsing
with light. The Borg seems distant, as if in some kind of silent
communication. Be cautious about attacking: the Collective communicates
with all Borgs remembering the form of your attack and adapting its
defense.

Borg Queen   67303
The Borg Queen is the supremely powerful entity at the heart of the Borg
Collective. Her cyborg structure is a metallic brain which gives her a
luminous and beautiful appearance and an intricate mechanical spinal
column which is hidden within a black shroud. She hungers for other
cultures, assimilating them into her righteous plan for the perfect
society. Appearing to be self-aware, she is a hive queen whose mind
controls the complex Borg network with but a single thought. She stands
calmly to one side of the room and clearly considers your presence more
for her amusement than any threat.


A Square.
This is a small square of a strange and unknown kind of black material.
It shimmers slightly, either containing an inner power source or
resonating with an external force. The edges are shaped to connect to
something else, clearly this is only a part of a larger object.

A Cube.
The small cube is jet black and constructed of an unknown material. It
hums, coupled in some way to an external force. What purpose it serves
is not clear, but as it shimmers it appears almost as if it is
communicating with some outside entity.

A Triangle.
This is a small triangle of a strange and unknown kind of dark gray
material. It shimmers slightly, either containing an inner power source
or resonating with an external force. The edges are shaped to connect to
something else, clearly this is only a part of a larger object.

A Tetrahedron.
The small tetrahedron is dark gray and constructed of an unknown
material. It hums, coupled in some way to an external force. What
purpose it serves is not clear, but it shimmers and appears to be almost
communicating with some outside entity.

Open-Ended Cylinder.
This is a small object made from a strange and unknown kind of light
gray material. It is shaped as a cylinder with only one end covered
over. It shimmers slightly, either containing an inner power source or
resonating with an external force. The open end is shaped to connect to
something else, clearly this is only a part of a larger object.

A Cylinder.
The small enclosed cylinder is light gray and constructed of an unknown
material. It hums, coupled in some way to an external force. What
purpose it serves is not clear, but it shimmers and appears to be almost
communicating with some outside entity.

A Sphere. (Plasma Marble)
The outer shell of the small sphere is transparent and inside you can
see it is filled with a glowing white plasma which is radiating light.
It hums, coupled in some way to an external force. What purpose it
serves is not clear, but it shimmers and appears to be almost
communicating with some outside entity.

Plasma Marble
Exquisitely crafted/magicked, this pristine little plasma bauble is the
whimsical, residual aftermath of peeronic thought.  Sadly, the entropic
tendencies of such mental energies are difficult to grasp or maintain.
A marble will inevitably evanesce and reform in an infinite number of
cryptic locations.


Adaptive Armour.
This armor is almost alive, linked forever in essence with the Borg
Collective consciousness. Its black surface is perfectly smooth and it
has a strange texture, almost as if it might be biological rather than
synthetic. It changes nature whenever it is hit adapting to better
defend against the form of attack. Never forget this armor is Borg, its
link with the Collective will never be completely severed.
