A Lion's Fur.
The golden color of this exquisite lion fur glimmers with a radiance
unheard of for the skin of a normal creature. Indeed, the great beast
whose skin this was, had immense power and authority bestowed to it by
a magical means. To wear this skin is to take on those qualities of
that extraordinary creature.
