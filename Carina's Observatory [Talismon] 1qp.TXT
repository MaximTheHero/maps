A wandering tourist    19719
One of those irritating tourists that flash their camera at nearly
everything and everyone.  He wanders around aimlessly bumping into anyone
that walks by.  Some people should really be put out of their misery.

A belligerent tourist (mean)   18943
One of those irritating tourists that flash their camera at nearly
everything and everyone.  He wanders around aimlessly bumping into anyone
that walks by.  Some people should really be put out of their misery.

A tourist that looks confused     37400
One of those irritating tourists that flash their camera at nearly
everything and everyone.  He wanders around aimlessly bumping into anyone
that walks by.  Some people should really be put out of their misery.

Observatory scientist    44135
A scientist that wanders through the observatory jotting down important
information on a small notebook, and then runs off to inform Carina.  He
wanders around making sure the tourists are happy and content while they
visit, and if a one of them is being harassed, he jumps in to their
defense.

Observatory specialist   41604
This man looks rather important.  He supervises the Observatory's workers
and employees.  He is dressed in a white overcoat and has a small clipboard
at his side.  It looks like he's having a meeting of sort, so you better
not bother him.

Observatory technician   38325
A very skilled operator of the Observatory's telescope and other advanced
equipment.  His main job is to keep things operating smoothly and to their
fullest capacity.

A Tour Guide who's way too happy     32647
This tall young woman holds a whistle in one hand and a brochure in the
other.  With each exhibit she passes, she reads word for word out of the
brochure, about the signifigance and scientific facts about each display.
Often her group of tourists leave her side and explore on their own, but
does it matter that she has no one to talk to?  Hell no!  She keeps on
babbling!  You wish someone would just shut her up.

Cepheus the Stargazer   45580
Cepheus seems hard at work, fiddling with the telescope.  A few tweaks here
and a few adjustments there.  He looks over at you with an evil grin
plastered to his face.  Looks like he wants you to take part in his
experiments.  Talk to him, he may give you some valuable information you
have been searching for.

Carina the leading Astronomer    117104
She seems busy at work, calculating formulae, drawing out sketches and
astronomical figures on a sheet of paper.  A middle aged woman who seems to
be very experienced in her work.  She is extremely friendly.  However,
don't think she will go lightly by any aggression on your part.  Her
speeches have been known to be quite fatal indeed.


A 35mm super camera
A small camera with dual flash bulbs, and an extra long lens for those
distant shots.  The silver dial on the face of the camera glistens under
the light.  Looking down at the film counter, you see the number 60.  You
wonder what film the owner of this camera was using to have so many shots
available.

A camera with someone's initials on it
A small camera with dual flash bulbs, and an extra long lens for those
distant shots.  The silver dial on the face of the camera glistens under
the light.  Looking down at the film counter, you see the number 57.  You
wonder what film the owner of this camera was using to have so many shots
available.

A vivitar elite
A small camera with dual flash bulbs, and an extra long lens for those
distant shots.  The silver dial on the face of the camera glistens under
the light.  Looking down at the film counter, you see the number 54.  You
wonder what film the owner of this camera was using to have so many shots
available.

A polaroid camera
A small camera with dual flash bulbs, and an extra long lens for those
distant shots.  The silver dial on the face of the camera glistens under
the light.  Looking down at the film counter, you see the number 30.  You
wonder what film the owner of this camera was using to have so many shots
available.

A small clipboard
The clipboard seems to have a small list on it of workers'
schedules and appointments.

A notebook
The notebook reads:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
  Movement in the Antares system has grown
 and we fear the transporter lock is drawing
 the inhabitants back here.
   We must shut down the beam before it is
 too late.
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Lab coat
A small white lab coat that many observatory scientists wear.  It has a
small pocket in it to hold whatever pens and pencils the scientists needs
to record strange space anomilies.  It drapes down about to your knees and
could offer some small protection against the elements.

A silver whistle
Just an ordinary silver whistle.  The observatory tourguide
carries one around just like this one.  When she feels things
are getting out of hand, she blows the whistle to calm down
her group of tourists.

Observatory brochure
The brochure contains many galactic pictures of distant star
constellations and proper nomenclature for each.  The exhibits
of the observatory are highlighted and underlined for easy and
detailed reading by the tourguide.

A glass key
A small crystal key that is as clear as glass.

Carina's planisphere
A planisphere is a useful tool in the astronomy field.  It is a device that
helps you identify the constellations at any time on any night of the year.
By rotating the disk, you expose through the tool, a view for the
particular time and date you choose.  This one however seems to have a
magical glow about it.
+1 Wis, +2 Int, -2 Cha

A scrap of paper
This is a crumpled scrap of paper that the scientist Carina
was holding onto at the time of her death. Perhaps reading
the scrap would give you some insight.
	I have discovered a new asteroid in the Amara Sector today. We've
	attempted to discover more about it, but we're having a hard time
	getting the telescope to lock on to it. The last known coordinates
	of the asteroid were x=45 and y=90.

A star chart
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
              Explored Realms
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
 Here is a listing of those outer galaxies that
 we have been fortunate enough to discover.

   1) Draco       (40,35)
   2) Serpens     (30,30)
   3) Hercules    (50,10)
   4) Aquarius    (70,40)
   5) Perseus     (100,5)

 The list seems to end, but keep checking.  We
 are searching the stars everyday for some new
 galaxy to explore.

Al Armstrong spacesuit
The embroidered letters N.A.S.A have been sew into the suit on
both the collar and left front pocket.  A large patch with a solar
wave and satelite on the right front breast pocket signifies the
emblem of the NASA Corporation.  The ever present American flag
on the left shoulder shows who is in charge of the Space race.
You are amazed at the condition of this Al Armstrong rendition
spacesuit.  Even the attaching hood looks like the original.

XL75-A Transponder
  This small electronic device looks rather like something you might
  have seen on old episodes of Star Trek.  Fitting within the palm of
  your hand, you wonder whether it operates in the same fashion.
  You see a small touch-pad screen roughly the size of your thumb along
  the face of the device.  Perhaps you simply press your thumb-print
  upon it to engage its internal circuits.

The Observatory T-shirt
Upon the back of the T-shirt is a globe of the Earth in the center, and the
other 8 planets of the solar system surrounding it.  Upon the front you see
in felt lettering the phrase; 'I visited the great Observatory of Chaos'.
The bold lettering crosses over from one side to the other.  This is just a
small item to remember your visit.

A pouch of moon-rocks (glowing)
The radioactive moon-rocks within the clear lining bag
glow luminously.  You are just chagrined at having a
little something from the moon that lights up the night
sky.  You watch as the flickering light illuminates the
room around you.

An Observatory laser pen
The Observatory laser pen is used by Tourguides and the like, to point out
any interesting artifacts on star maps and charts.  The pen glows with a
red light and is apparently internally charged.  You might be able to use
this in battle.  Imagine blinding your foes with the laser beam.

A model of 'Challenger'
The model rocket has a self-attaching stand that is used to
launch it out into space.  The white colored shuttle has the
N.A.S.A insignia painted across its fuselage.  You could target
someone if you wanted to.  It would be nice to see the space
shuttle 'Challenger' lift off once again.  If needed, the
shuttle targetting can be blocked with 'targetblock'.

A little, yellow rock  - Suphur Marble
This is a little yellow rock that looks like it is from another
world. It is perfectly round, but it smells REALLY bad. Perhaps
somebody could identify it for you so you can learn more about it.
