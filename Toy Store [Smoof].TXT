1: A toy helicopter



The Shopkeeper - unkillable
The shopkeeper stands behind the counter, adjusting the screws on some
sort of motor. He's deeply engrossed in his work, which appears to
have taken a great deal of his time. His eyes are red and bloodshot
and his clothes are falling apart. He appears to have not slept in
days.

The mother   1299
She's wearing rather nice clothes--this family must have been lucky
and avoided serious damage in the war. You can see the happiness in
her eyes as she watches her children play. It must be quite a relief
from her normal activity.

The father   2423
This is a big man. He's a little over six feet tall and looks at you
with scorn in his eyes. He looks much tougher than his children. He
seems to be in a different world--he's not even paying attention to
his own family.

A bratty kid   163
This kid looks like a real brat. He's wearing designer jeans and his
black shirt has chocolate ice cream stains all over it. You can't help
but laugh when you see his red hair and freckles.

A normal kid   327
This is just a normal kid, wearing a plain t-shirt and shorts. He's
playing with a superball in the corner and not bothering anyone.




A remote control
This is the controller for a helicopter. The screen located on the  front
displays only static. The helicopter must be out of  range or deactivated.
The directions on the side read:
control <dir>   :       move in a particular direction
control look    :       look at the present room
activate        :       activate the helicopter
deactivate      :       deactivate the helicopter
control land    :       land the helicopter
