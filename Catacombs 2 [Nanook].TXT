A Guide of Catacombs    28658
This aging adventurer seems right at home here in the ruins of
the dwarven citadel.  He's probably lived here for ages, fending
for himself amid the dangerous tunnels you've entered.  He smiles
at you with a mischievious gleam in his eye.

A large Rat     68703
A monstrous rat scurries out of the circle of light you carry with
you.  The thing is huge, nearly three feet long and that doesn't
include the tail.  You can't imagine what magics or freaks of
evolution produced these hideous creatures, but they're here and
they're hungry.

A goblin warrior     71112
A tough looking little creature.  His green skin and sickly yellow
eyes are totally repulsive to look upon.  A stench like years without
a bath comes from the little creature.  Your sense of horrified
wonder is all that forces you to look a second time, and it is then
that you notice that aside from the scraps of armour the creature
has scrounged together, it is totally naked.

A Goblin Lord    117253
This guy's gotta be the ugliest damn goblin you've ever come
across.  He's a little bigger than the other goblins, but that's
probably a good thing, or else he'd surely have been clubbed to
death as an orc-goblin crossbreed.



A small crystal key
A key of cloudy white crystal, almost like ice.  It is about the
width of your palm and isn't cold to the touch like you'd expect
it to be.  Wonder what it opens.

a chalky white club (glowing)
A short handled mace of chalky white.  A dense knobby head curls
up and out of the shaft leaving an strangely asymmetrical weapon.
The end of the handle is jagged, as if broken off of some longer
shaft.  All of a sudden it hits you.  This isn't just some strange
goblin forged weapon, it is the femur of some poor soul who has
rotted away here in the darkness.

a suit of tattered leather armor (glowing)
A scarred and torn suit of leather armour.  It smells rather bad and
probably isn't worth a whole lot when it comes to protection, but it's
better than nothing.

a rusty sword (glowing)
A rusty shortsword.  The pommel is worn smooth from use.  This once
proud weapon has been brought low through neglect and abuse.

a worm eaten shield (glowing)
An ancient wooden shield gone to waste.  The once sturdy wood is
crumbling with age and losing its battle with termites and worms.
