Rirar the kangaroo   12879
Standing before you is a male brick red colored Kangaroo wearing a
pair of red boxing gloves. Rising to a height of 6 feet this kangaroo
must weigh almost 200 pounds. With a long flat tail and a low centre
of gravity this beast would make a for a powerful opponent.
Embroidered on a large pair of blue oversized boxing shorts is the
word 'Rirar'. He seems to be very skilled with those gloves, perhaps
you could learn a thing or two.

Hindra the kangaroo   16248
Hindra has bluish grey fur, with a black and white marking on the
sides of her muzzle. A Broad white stripe runs from the corner of her
mouth to the base of her ear. Standing 5 feet tall Hindra shows no
signs of fear.


Boxing Gloves
This is a pair of large red boxing gloves that appear to have
some laces hanging from each cuff. Made from leather they look
like they have taken years of abuse.

A block of salt
This blue cube is solid and weighs about 4 pounds. The color of this
cube makes it easily identified as ingestible by livestock only.
