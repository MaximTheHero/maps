A tornado of Kayos energy
Pure Kayos energy has been loosed upon the field!  Something -- or
someone -- must have ripped asunder to unleash this fury of uncaged
magicks.  The tornado rips across the battlefield, tearing up dirt and
blood and consuming its basic energies, becoming more powerful with
each terrifying moment.

Thorion the Hammer
Thorion the Hammer is hard to see behind the constant shroud of
electrical energy that surrounds him at all times.  What you can make
out is muscles, muscles, and more muscles.  In his left hammer he
holds a large, rune-etched hammer.  In his right hammer he holds a
similar hammer.  Yes, you read that right.  He likes hammers.

A flameroller
The flame roller is a giant ball of metal, blood, and shadow that
spits flame in all directions as it wanders aimlessly around the
battlefield.  Clearly a weapon designed solely to sew chaos among the
enemy.  The flames gout upwards, powered by Kayos energy.

A demon soldier
One of the footsoldiers of the teeming Kayos armies.  These types of
demons could pass for human in a crowded, darkened room.  This one has
a broken arm, and is holding it awkwardly.

Yttra the Great Worm
Before you stands one of the great creatures of legend - Yttra the
Great Worm.  She who devoured Kakhradur.  She who devoured Sintopole.
She who devoured the entire world of Qua'ra'mek.  A giant insatiable
worm with a shadowy maw at the end, rimmed with thousands -- millions!
-- of teeth.  Her size belies her legend -- unless something shadowy
is afoot.

A refugee
The refugee is clearly shell shocked and has almost given up all hope
of survival.  She looks ahead blanky, and is only going through the
motions of survival at this point.  Torn and ragged clothes barely
hang on her scrawny frame.  You can't even begin to imagine the
horror, or how shecame to be trapped on this battlefield nightmare.

A small imp
This diminutive imp is formed from the energies of Kayos.  It is a
shadowy creature that darts hither and yon.  It is humanoid, but the
proportions are all wrong.  Small horns adorn its head, and its webbed
feet are covered in dirt and blood.

Karaket the Twisted God-King
There is nothing human left of Karaket.  Where once there may have
been a proud barbarian lord, there is nothing but hatred and malice
taken physical shape.  Shadow and blood course over the surface of
Karaket's body, and his twin broadswords have fused into his fists.
His mouth has disappeared into the scares on his face but that has not
stopped his constant screams of mixed joy and agony.

A time-lost pirate
It's a pirate!  An actual pirate!  The eyepatch, the hat, the pegleg,
the whole bit!  How did a pirate end up in this mess?  The pirate
looks around wildly, clearly wondering the same thing.

A robotic lion
The robotic lion is squat and powerful.  Long snaking cables extend
out from the rim of its head, duplicating the mane of an actual lion.
Its gleaming white exterior suggests that it has only just arrived on
the field of battle.

A robotic velociraptor
The claws of this metal raptor are covered in dripping, wet blood.
The raptor looks around quickly, its head snapping back and forth
faster than you can see.  It quivers, ready to jump at a moment's
notice.

A robotic hound
The robotic hound is a mess of metal and machinery.  It only roughly
resembles a dog, but it's robot through and through.  Its glossy white
surfaces are stained with smoke, dust, and blood.  From it emanates a
screeching metal-on-metal noise.

A TANK
IT'S A TANK.  This thing is out of someone's nightmare -- covered in
roiling shadow and boiling blood.  You can't imagine what the turret
is for, or what ammunition it uses.  It leaves behind no trace of its
passing.

A robotic tiger
The robotic tiger is a lithe and elegant piece of machinery.  Powered
by the dark energies of Kayos, though, and it becomes wildly
unpredictable.  The metallic fangs extend down long past its face,
almost dragging on the ground.




An intricate digital key

This key is fascinating!  It looks like a glossy silver tube, but
small lights flicker and blink along it.  It is bound to dimension
????????.

A dark mass of energy
The blob of dark energy moves and shifts in your hand.  It's clearly
very powerful, and could be used as a power cell of some kind.  If you
were completely evil and had no problem with that sort of thing.

Roiling Kayos Energy
This is pure Kayos Energy.  Be careful!  It spirals and sputters and charges the air about
you.
There are 12 empowers left that will expire in 21593 seconds.

A briefcase.
It's a small metallic briefcase.  It looks important.  You shouldn't
open it, someone might get angry.
