read lesson
It's a very strange version of a schoolchild's lesson:

  He thought he saw a Rattlesnake
    That questioned him in Greek:
  He looked again and found it was
    The Middle of Next Week.
  'The one thing I regret', he said,
    'Is that it cannot speak!'

a tabby Cat (Dinah)  3856
A chubby tabby with long whiskers and inquisitive green eyes.  Her fur
is quite soft - she must spend an awful lot of the time cleaning
herself!  She is sure-footed and flicks her tail.

a white Kitten (Snowdrop)   3649
A snow white kitten with huge sapphire eyes.  She is spunky and seems
excited and fascinated by absolutely everything.  Her fur is a little
matted in places, as if she's been getting into things she shouldn't be
and doesn't know how to clean herself up yet.

a black Kitten (Kitty)  2491
A coal black kitten with huge sapphire eyes.  He is full of mischief,
scampering all over the place.  His tail twitches, as he looks around
the room.

Henry Liddell   6657
A stern man in dark robes, Henry Liddell is the Dean of Christ Church at
Oxford.  The top of his head is bald, with a halo of wispy white curls
encircling his head.  Dark piercing eyes are set into pale wrinkled
skin.  His nose is sharp and beak-like, and his mouth seems to be
perpetually frowning.

Charles Dodgson   5606
Charles Lutwidge Dodgson is a man with a weak chin and a high forehead,
with curly brown hair that's combed straight back.  He wears a long coat
as he stands in his classroom.  His eyes are wide and twinkling, a
brilliant pale blue.  His hands are clasped together and he looks to be
lost in thought or dreams.

Rose   13785
The Rose towers mightily above the rest of the flowers in the bed, full
of majestic confidence.  Her soft crimson petals open to reveal
intelligent features with assessing eyes.  Her stalk is strong, and
serrated leaves tip vicious looking thorny vines.

Daisy   11388
This Daisy is an understatedly beautiful flower.  She droops on a long
narrow stalk and has short leaves.  Plentiful petals make a big white
circle around her lemon yellow face.

Violet   13906
The sleepy Violet is curled up in her big leaves, staying low to the
ground and out of the direct sunlight.  She has a tiny pert face amidst
three beautiful purple leaves streaked with lemon.

Tiger-lily   12420
One of the more distinctive flowers in the garden, this Tiger-Lily
stands proudly up in the bed.  Her speckled orange petals are swept back
away from her cool beautiful face.  The blades of her leaves look wicked
sharp.




a pair of whiskers
A pair of whiskers, without a kitty.  No matter how hard you look, you
can't seem to find the cat!

ball of worsted
A ball of worsted.  The dark green yarn seems to have a few kinks in it,
as though someone was messing with it.

a flower petal
A soft flower petal, moist with dew.
