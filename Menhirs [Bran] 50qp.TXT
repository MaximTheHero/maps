qinfo (allegedly)
Go to the Wayhaven library and look up Cernunnos and runes.  Go north
and east of Wayhaven and find the  druidic stones there (Tor - [Bran]),
in the center of the stones there's a pebble, get it and rub it.
Kill this incarnation of Cernunnos - Cernunnos is the Celtic
leader of the hunt.  Okay, now go to the Cernunnos area (east forest
portal/e/4s/w/2s/w/s (Menhirs [Bran]),there's a dark cleric, worship ernunnos.  Get into the
forest and climb to the top of the hill-
To get out of the forest you'll have to find a path at the bottom of the hill that leads south back to
the entrance, it'll be hidden as well. Go to the top of the hill, look at the
runes on the stones you pass and try and make head or tales of them.  At
the top of the hill you'll have to rub your pebble again and itll say something
about warming the stones. get a torch and light the fires at the bases of the
stones. the rub the pebble again. it says you need something conductive,
which is an amulet.  from here go w, nw, ne, e, se, sw, and search around for
it. then go back to the top, rub pebble and kill cernunnos. this time though
you get a sword and helmet when you kill him. Then to finish the quest kill all
the menhir's but examine the rune on each one, finally you'll kill one with a @
rune and you'll get the qps.  Don't leave the area until you kill the right one.
They respawn fairly quick so just map the place and follow your map until you've
killed each menhir.
can't sort out what to do to 'master the runes'
