A pilgrim of Syrinx    3711
A pilgrim who has come to the Temple of Syrinx to seek answers from the
priests.  He appears at peace with himself and the world.  His head is
bowed in reverence.  He is humble in all aspects from his calm brown
eyes to his dusty and rumpled tunic.  He smiles at you in greeting.

A priest of Syrinx    14237
A priest of the Temples of Syrinx.  He stands tall and proud as he
glances down at you.  His face is calm and collected.  His robes,
plain, are finely woven and you cannot see a single wrinkle or piece
of lint anywhere on them.  Everything about him is neat and orderly.
His hair is short and groomed to perfection with a small part on the
left that runs as straight an arrow.  Dark beads shine beneath trimmed
eyebrows and hold an inner fire of passion that makes you wonder if
this man leads the people for their benefit or his own.

The dictator of Syrinx    37330
This is an intimidating fellow.  He stands about two meters and his
chest and shoulders are massive.  His robes hang open, revealing an
impressive grey suit and tie.  His hair is clipped short and fashionable
while his brows form furrows as he glares at you.  Your assumption here
is that this is the man in charge of the temple.  His sharp eyes freeze
your feet and your stomach ties into a knot.







Amulet of Syrinx
This amulet is made of gold threads twisted into a braided chain.
The object hanging from the chain is a twisted conglomeration of
circles and lines.  Some of the lines form arrows pointing outward
while others end bluntly.  It is rather ugly to observe and looks much
too heavy to comfortably wear.
