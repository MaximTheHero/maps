Mobs:
An ecoterrorist   71
A thin man with a fanatical flare in his eyes.  Something tells
you (maybe the stun baton or that glint) that this guy isn't a
MorTex worker even though he's wearing the company's suit.

A MorTex Oil worker

Items:
A stun baton
A police issue stun baton, obviously pirated from someone's
warehouse.  This thing probably gives a pretty good kick when
you whack someone with it.

A morTex Oil jumpsuit
An insulated and nearly puncture-proof jumpsuit blazened with
the MorTex Oil logo across the front and the back.  This one's
obviously seen a lot of use, since it's covered with oil stains
and other gunk.

A small pair of wire cutters
A small pair of wire cutters that are barely as large as your
hand.  These are obviously for fine work, like on control consoles
or similar wiring, definately nothing you'd find in an oil field.
But, if you did find something to use them on, a little 'clip' is
all you'd need to cut it.

A digital multimeter
A small rectangular box of plastic with a small dial selector and
a liquid crystal readout.  It's got two probes on short leads which
dangle from one end.  You remember reading somewhere that you can
use these to 'test' for voltages in wires.
