The Prismatic Jewel of Dragons


qinfo
First things first. Do your research.

Goto the Wayhaven Library, and lookup all that you can. Prismatic Jewel, 
Prismatic Dragons, Dragon Isle, etc etc. Theres plenty of lookups, I cannot 
remember them all.

Now head to tapan.

If you are familiar with the Mira quest, this should be simple. 

On the east side of tapan is a cliff you can climb down, climb down it, and 
enter the cave. In here is a dragon protecting gold. If I recall theres a Mira 
quest item in here, but that is not the purpose of our visit. Get the gold.

Getting the gold will not get the gold, but will simply anger the Red Dragon.

Have a bit of a peck at it, but don't kill it. This is important. After a while, 
the fight will stop, the dragon will pick you up in its claws, and dump you 
on the Prismatic Jewel Island.

Items you will need for the solution.

A red bag. A stalagmite. A 'coloured' gem.

The quest is actually very simple.

The bag can load in several places. It can be on some flowers near some 
monkeys in the tree. Or it can be in one of the various dragon nests. It 
may also be in the human's cave. I've only ever found it in the tree with 
one character, and the nest in another.

The stalagmite can probably load in any cave that has stalagmites.
'break stalagmite' for me it was in the start cave.

First things first.

Drop everything. And I mean ecerything. If it did not autoload on, you 
shouldn't be carrying it. If you have a weightless way of transporting 
equipment, such as a follower or wieghtless guild bag, use it. If you are 
carrying anything, anything at all, even items that reduce wieght, this 
section of the quest will fail.

Leave the opening cave and turn northwards. You may have to despatch a 
dragon. Most of the dragons are 80k and reasonably harmless. The pearl 
one can stun real bad. Climb the cliff. It might be good form to actually try 
and work this out and fail abit. Falling off the cliff will cost you hp. If you've 
given up or just want to plain well cheat, the path is following:

Bam. You're on the cliff. Follow the path around, entering all the caves, 
searching all the bones, killing all the dragons. Take one of each gem. 
You only need one gem total, but you wont know which one that is for 
quite some time.

Follow the path all the way to the end, and go visit the proper questy 
dragon if you like. He'll attack you if you don't have prismatic jewel.

We're done here for now.

Go back to the start of this volcano top, and jump down. Head south, and 
down into the jungle.

Sw,s from the jungle start is a hidden cave. Search and find it. If theres a 
nest, enter it, and search about. If the dragons prevent you from 
searching mud, then the red pouch is here. Check for a stalagmite if you 
dont have one. Move on.

se,se,e,e is another cave location. Repeat.

e,e,ne is a liana. 'climb liana'. Its a type of vine, if that ever becomes 
relevant. Check the flowers / monkeys for the red pouch. Down we go.

e,ne,ne Another Liana. This one actually allows us to cross the river we 
have been following. Don't cross over just yet.


e,e brings us to a liana drop. We can climb down there, and get into an 
inlet with a waterfall. Behind the waterfall is a humans dwelling. This may 
be a location for the red pouch. I honestly do not know. Go lagoon, beach.

Check the cave out. Get the rest of the rooms, theres only a few, and 
nothing to search. When you're done, return to the waterfall and 'push 
off'.

This will return you to  Tapan. Back to flying on 
dragonclaw. Back to the liana we climbe down.

2w, climb liana, across, d, 2 nw, here is another cave. Red bag, 
stalagmites. Etc.

== BE CAREFUL ==

In the next rooms, nw is a group of 4 killer bees.

They will all attack you. They all do addhp2 damage. Yes, not addhp, 
addhp2. It can be as heavy as 120hp per round. The room is wimpyable. 
But very dangerous. Kill everything, move on. 

West of here is another tree, climb, bag etc. Follow the one way path 
westward. All w. 2 sw, hidden cave, bag etc.

 Keep going.

2 more sw and you will come across a bush. Search the bush for a ring. 
Remember the old qinfo saying Peridot ring of adornment is really a 
marble, and trying to get one, and get your marble? Well this is the 
peridot ring of adornment. It isnt any ring of adornment, its this specific 
one. Get your marble. Continue along the path. You will encounter a leaf 
man, he is similar to the killer bees.Theres another three caves. Two 
insignifcant ones, and one impotant one. There is also one liana to climb.

Into the significant cave. The bat cave.

Head north and you will come to a dead ender. Search corner. Cave opens 
up. Map it. Theres 56 rooms. All obvious. GO up when you get there. There 
are plenty of mobs here, the death bats are great, and the invisible 
wraiths can be killed by searching shadows. Every single room contians 
stock text. Search for credibility, but dont expect to find anything. Onto the 
next floor. Stairs on the southeast side btw.

Same deal. Search, make bs gxp, whatever, Stairs are on the north side.

Third floor. This one matters.
2e, se, s, search rubble. Find hidden exit. I didn't see any point to it. 
Perhaps it will matter to your instance.

sw,3w, search about. Hidden tunnel.
Follow it. When you're trapped by a web, clear it.

== Exact Dirs Stop Here ==

I appear to have misplayed my prismatic jewel maps.
Anyway. Follow the stairs down, and eventually you will meet a mob.

say master.
say price.

He will want a -colour- gem.

The syntax is 'pay colour' I think. Its not give. And its never gem. You 
manipulate the colour. I solved this quite a while ago. Qinfo/Maps half 
missing. Anyway. Give over the gem and you're allowed in.

Now you're in a room with a vampire. Don't try to kill it, you'll die. He's 
immune to every damagetype. 'throw stalagmite' to kill the vampire. 
Open the coffin for the prismatic jewel. Put it in the pouch, and make you 
way back to the top of the volcano.

Get the gem out of the pouch, and give it to the dragon in the middle of 
the Caldera. You're done.
