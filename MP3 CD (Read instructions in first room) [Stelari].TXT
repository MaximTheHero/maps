               Welcome!

You find yourself inside a weird and wonderful
place, one that does not follow the normal rules
of moving around.  You must sing your way
through the area, using the title of the song
in which you are currently positioned.  If you
get stuck, you can always try singing that oldie-
but-goodie, We gotta get out of this place!
It is hard to tell, but you could possibly
wonder about how many songs you have seen.
Remember, so long as you don't attack anything,
this place is safe to explore!

               Have fun!

wonder - You think that you have made it to song 1, out of 17.
