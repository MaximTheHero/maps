A Giant Lizard   1214
Surely this monster must be mutated from normal lizards.  It looks
like a five-lined skink, but it's over five feet long!  It is the
burnt orange color of an adult skink, with some black lines that give
it its name still visible on its sides.  Its throat fan is extended
and it's prepared to defend its territory.


A chunk of lizard meat
Lizard tartare--if that's your thing then this meat would be perfect.
The hunk of raw meat is grayish with splotches of blood still on it. A
few ragged scales are hanging off the edge.

environment you are in:
The following items can be examined in this room: 
door
Could someone have driven off the upper edge of the sinkhole?  It appears so
from the skeletons inside the vehicle.

auto

from the skeletons inside the vehicle.

roots
Once the trees have some weightier branches and foliage, they are too heavy for
the soft ground to support.  The trees then slowly fall over, exposing the root
ball.  There are a number of dead trees lying around at these odd angles as well
as some that are still alive.

soil
The ground is very wet.

breeding ground
If you look carefully you can see larvae or tadpoles swimming around in some of
the puddles.

sinkhole
The beauty of the sinkhole is stunning!

set
Creatures must come down to the creek for water, or perhaps to lay in wait for
prey.  One set of tracks looks human, and ends where it looks like someone was
digging.

foliage
The abundance of water and nutrient-rich soil helps these plants grow extremely
tall.

trees

skeleton
There are two skeletons in what used to be the passenger compartment of the
vehicle, or you assume so.  There are two skulls anyway, and an assortment of
bones--some attached to others, and some loose.

insects
These creatures have a perfect environment in which to grow and thrive.

The bones have been exposed by water and scavengers.  It's hard to tell how long
they've been here.

creek
The water which pours into the sinkhole from the surrounding areas via the
waterfalls has collected into this small creek on the sinkhole floor.  There are
some tracks in the mud nearby.
