1: Onyxx, the Crystalline Overseer

A Crystalline Warrior    34744
At first glance, this could be merely a statuesque woman of extreme
beauty. Looking more closely, however, it is apparent that she is made
entirely from crystal. Her eyes are a clear sapphire, her cheeks the
delicate pink of rose quartz, her lips the bold red of a ruby. She is
clothed in armour of glowing crystal, and her hands themselves seem to
be her weapons. She seems resolute in her determination to survive.

A Crystalline Lady    38618
This is a member of the nobility of the Crystal Palace. She looks
somehow more delicate than the warrior who guarded her, but no less
refined. Her features are just as angular, but the colours are paler,
her eyes a sky blue, her lips rose-pink. She is a creature of a cold and
hard beauty, resolutely determined to find any other survivors of the
catastrophe that ruined her home.

Onyxx, the Crystalline Overseer    122795
This creature is made of completely black crystal, in stark contrast to
the white caverns. He is bulky, gleaming in multiple shades of black
from huge crystalline muscles. He keeps an eagle eye over his workers,
and occasionally directs one to another area, but he never seem to need
to rebuke or chastise the workers in any way.

A Crystalline Worker     13751
This creature resembles a man made of crystal, his skin a shade of
dusky quartz. His eyes are a clear black, and his skin doesn't show much
variation of colour. He goes about his tasks with a single minded
efficiency, reminding you of an ant scurrying here or there.

Quartz, the Crystalline Warleader   104071
Quartz is a curious creature, coloured all shades of quartz.  Her
lips are a deep ruby red, her cheeks flushed with the pink of rose
quartz.  Her eyes are deep emerald green, and her skin glows with a soft
light, giving the impression of translucence, though she seems very
solid.  She stands over six feet tall, an imposing figure against the
luminescent crystal of her home.




Rod of the Overseer (enchanted)
This weapon looks more like a whip or flail than a rod in the technical
sense. Several flexible tails made of barbed crystal are attached to a
hook at one end, looking very painful, if a bit fragile.

Blood Red Quartz
The Blood Red Quartz is a perfectly formed double terminated quartz
crystal.  The ends are sharp enough to puncture flesh, but this doesn't
appear to be intended as a weapon.  The crystal pulses with warmth,
almost in the pattern of a beating heart, and you get the impression
that it wants to 'feed'.
