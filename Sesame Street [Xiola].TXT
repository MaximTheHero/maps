Gordon   339
This is Gordon. He is one of the human adults which lend Sesame
Street some good old fashion role models. Gordon is black, with
a bald shiney head. He's not as tall as Big Bird, but he still
makes the little kids look even smaller.

Suzy   163
This is Suzy. She is a cute little purple girl with long blond hair.
She is happily sitting on the steps and playing jacks all alone. She
is wearing a pretty little pink dress and black leather maryjanes.

Elmo  176
Elmo is a small gangly red thing. He looks a lot like Grover, only
a different colour and with a eggshaped head. He is riding a tricycle
around the street.

Big Bird   732
This is Big Bird. He is a hero for all children. He demonstrates goodness
and peace between your neighbours. He never fights with people and
everybody loves him. His yellow feathers radiate happiness.

Snuffleupagus   338
Snuffleupagus is a HUGE wooly-mammoth type monster with shaggy brown
fur growing all over him. He has very long eyelashes and looks very
docile. His bright blue eye lids almost blind you, but you quickly
get over the light change as he continues to stare and blink at you.

Alice   92
This is Alice. She is Snuffleupagus' girlfriend. She looks almost
exactly like him, but is a lighter shade of brown and wears a
huge pink bow on one of her furry ears.

Slimey the Worm   80
Slimey is a tiny worm. He doesn't talk, but he can understand what
people say to him. He just nods to whatever anyone says and crawls
around on the wall.

Telly   416
Telly is a really large maroon monster. He is kinda round.. actually
you guess you'd say he's more egg-shaped. He has an elongated orange
nose and tall, silly feathers protruding from the top of his head.

Grover   183
Grover is a furry blue monster with quite a large mouth. He has some
really red lips as well. He likes to pretend he is a farmer, and this
farm is the perfect place to make-believe. He is wearing a red bandana
tied around his neck and a pair of rubber boots on his feet. The sharp
pitchfork in his hand looks pretty deadly.

Super Duck   390
It's a bird.. It's a plane.. It's SUPER DUCK! Wait.. he IS a bird. Oh,
well. He is a hero among the farm animals. If there ever is a problem,
if the tractor gets stuck in a hole, if the rooster forgets to crow,
SUPER DUCK is there to save the day!

Pigana Ross   163
This is Pigana Ross. She is wearing a shimmering red dress. It
compliments her large hairdo nicely. She is standing in front
of the microphone singing a song.

Oscar the Grouch   327
Oscar is a gross, dirty, furry, green monster with a big mouth and
grubby hands. There is a horrible odour coming from him. He is holding
the lid of his trash can in front of him as a shield.

Cookie Monster   211
Cookie Monster is a fat blue guy with big bubble eyes on the
top of his head. His mouth is rather large as well, so he can
stuff more cookies in, of course!

Kermit the Frog   183
Kermit is a green froggy. Everyone likes him because he is nice and
friendly. He is here to visit his favourite buddies, Bert and Ernie.
The fringe around his neck is a lighter green than the rest of him,
which you find kinda odd.

Bert   339
This is Bert. He is a skinny yellow man with a freaked-out hair-do. He
is sitting down in his armchair, listening to the radio. He is wearing
a geeky white turtle-neck shirt with a striped shirt over it. His
fashion sense sucks.

Ernie   389
Ernie is the best. He never thinks he bothers Bert, but he sure does!
He is singing at the top of his lungs while splashing around naked in
the tub. He has his duckie with him, pretending he is a boat.

Mary   183
Mary is the owner of the clothing store. She doesn't do much business
because she usually gives the stuff away instead of selling it!
She is wearing one of the cool floppy hats she has in the front of
the store.

Rod Rodburger   156
Rod Rodburger is the host of the Sesame Street gameshow. He is dressed
in a tacky green jacket and a sparkly red tie. He holds a small card
in his hand, which he reads the questions off of.

Charlene the Contestant   92
Charlene has yellow skin and a purple hair. Her nose is orange, giving
her a very rainbow-like appearance. She seems really into this game
and her eyes glaze over as she struggles to think of answers.

The Count   156
The is the Count. He counts everything he sees. He has a very large
nose and his skin is a pretty purple colour. He wears a black cape
and a monocle. He also has a bushy black goatee.




A silver jack
This is a small silver jack. It is used to play a cool game where
you bounce a ball and try to pick up as many jacks as you can while
still catching the ball. Little Suzy has thrown all the jacks at
you so you don't have a full set with which to play. Too bad.

A huge pink bow
This is Alice's huge pink bow. It is so big that it will fit over the
top of your small head.

A pitchfork
This is a pitchfork. It is quite plain. The wooden handle holds
the metal prongs tightly, so they won't fall off. The points
are quite sharp.

A plastic ring
This is a red plastic ring. There is an S ingraved on the front
of it. It looks pretty special.

A trash can lid
This is a trash can lid taken from Oscar's house. It has some rather
large dents in it, and there is a layer of muck covering the inside.
Other than the smell, it makes a sturdy shield.

A chocolate chip cookie
This is a chocolate chip cookie. There is a huge bite out of it.

Bert's shirt
This is Bert's striped shirt. The stripes are vertical instead of
horizonal, which distinguishes it from Ernie's. The V-neck makes it
quite a fashion statement.

A rubber duckie
This is a cute little yellow rubber duckie. If you squeeze it, it
will make a noise for you.

A monocle
This is the Count's monocle. When you wear it, you seem to notice
the actions of people around you more than usual.

A fire hose
This is a short fire hose. If you had a fire hydrant, you could
use this hose to shoot people with water.

A stuffed Cookie Monster
This is a cute little stuffed Cookie Monster. It's blue fur is
very fuzzy and soft. There is a little string sticking out of
the back of it, perhaps you can pull it.

An Area Compass
This is a cool compass which will show you the creator of the room
you are in. Simply type 'whereami' to get a glimpse at the very fine
wizard who spent time into making this mud such a cool place.
