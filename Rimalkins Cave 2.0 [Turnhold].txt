1: cave, Rimalkin King (2 lives, 95m)

A small Rimalkin
This is one of the smallest of the Rimalkin species.  It is very rat-like
and stands about 1.5 feet high at the shoulder.  Its body is covered with
mottled grey skin, with large hard sections on its 4 feet.  Each foot is
made up of a large claw, which looks sharp enough to tunnel through rock.
Its eyes glow reddish in the dim light, which peer at you, unblinking.

A large Rimalkin
This Rimalkin is slightly larger than its smaller cousins.  It is very
rat-like and stands about 2.5 feet high at the shoulder.  Its body is covered
with mottled grey skin, with large hard sections on its 4 feet.  Each foot
is made up of a large claw, which looks sharp enough to tunnel through rock.
It's eyes glow reddish in the dim light, which peer at you, unblinking.

A very large Rimalkin
This Rimalkin is the biggest and ugliest you have seen so far.  It is very
rat-like and stands about 3 feet high at the shoulder.  It's body is covered
with mottled grey skin, with large hard sections on its 4 feet.  Each foot
is made up of a huge claw, which looks sharp enough to tunnel through rock.
It's eyes glow reddish in the dim light, which peer at you, unblinking.

The King of the Rimalkins
This is the King of all Rimalkins. He is massively bigger than
any other creature you have encountered in this cave. His massive
rat-like claws gleam with an unholy light, and you see a glimmer
of more than average intelligence coming from his ravenous gaze.


Ring of Magical Deflection
A golden band of metal, with a small diamond in its center.
This armor provides special defense against melee attacks.
