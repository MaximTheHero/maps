Monsters:



This is a normal sized woman who looks like she's ready to take on the world.
From the looks of it, she doesn't really seem like she could
take on too much, since she does look a little scrawny, but she does have a
rather determined look in her eye. On the sleeve of her uniform you can
see the emblem of the Houston Transportation Center. HTC.



Items:

An ammo clip.
An ammunition clip, standard issue.

An HTC rifle.
This is a standard issue Houton Transporation Center rifle.
It is made out of black shiny plastic and metal, and is rather long and
vicious looking. It looks like it would fit pefectly up
against your shoulder or hip and make for a good weapon.

PlasmaCutter (broken) (spent).
This is a large piece of construction equipment. It is made out of
a shiny thick black plastic and towards the barrel of it there are lots
of yellow stripes. It looks rather squat thick and would probably snug
up close to your shoulder rather well. It has the word 'STRIKE' written
in blue letters across one side. This piece of equipment could probably
cut through solid rock, or be used as a rather mean weapon if it wasn't
broken and out of power.

MultiComponent Armour: Lower Arm Casing Component.
This is a a pair of oblong pieces of very light material. It feels like
metal but is warm to the touch, and has the feel of fabric. It looks
like it only would fit on the front of an individual, since it is
open in the back of it. Alas, it's obvious that you would need
the other components of this armour to assemble
and use it.
