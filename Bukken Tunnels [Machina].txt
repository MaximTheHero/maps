Items:

A note.
An old and crumpled note, the writing of which is blurred. You think
you can manage to read it however.

        I fear I do not have many days left in this world. It
        has been a week now since Daridd went missing in the
        Bukken tunnels, and alas it is my duty as a friend to
        go after him. His dissappearance is a sure sign that
        the Bukken have returned. For all my resistance to
        Daridd's claims, I fear he would not have gone down
        had it not been so. If you have found this note then
        the likelihood is that I am with my friend. The Bukken
        must be stopped at all cost! I believe at this time their
        presence is small, but their capacity to grow is incredible.
        There is a young scholar in the Wayhaven library who
        knows something of them. If they are not stopped then
        fantasy will once again be overrun until no one is safe...

A jagged dagger.
