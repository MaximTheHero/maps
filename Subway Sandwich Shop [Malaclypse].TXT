Eddy   71
White, late teens, and, frankly, speckled, Eddy gives off an air of
being above the menial task of serving you. The thin-eyed scowl on his
greasy face speaks derision and thoughts of escape, while his untucked
shirt and smeared-upon slacks speak of his utter disdain for this
necessary evil. Not the most pleasant kid in the world.



a loaf of bread
This is a twelve inch loaf of Subway(tm) bread. It looks like it was
freshly made in 1987, and has been used to clock trainees upside the
head ever since.
