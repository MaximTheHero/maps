Savage Warrior  3651
This is a member of the nomadic people who hunt on the plains of Dragon
Isle.  He is lean, and bears no weapons, as his hands and the tools he
can build from his surroundings are plenty to bring down enough food to
feed him.  He is a loner by choice, and is very wary of strangers.

/Small/Large green/blue/sand/black/red/cave/white dragon
Baby <color> dragon   12785
The small dragon hisses, baring its teeth in menace. It is very young,
really only a hatchling.  Beware, though, for even a small dragon can be
a deadly menace.  Its scales are <color> in colour.

Small <color> dragon   13202
The small dragon hisses, baring its teeth in menace. It is only a young
adult, still far away from its full growth. Beware, though, for even a
small dragon can be a deadly menace. Its scales are <color> in colour.

Large <color> dragon
The dragon hisses, baring its teeth in menace. It is a full adult,
though it is not ancient. Beware, for a dragon can be a deadly menace.
Its scales are <color> in colour.

Ardis, the Ranger of Dragon Isle
Ardis, the ranger of Dragon Isle, is a man of indeterminate age. His
weatherbeaten face seems to be lined more by hard work and the elements
than by time, but he moves like an old man, his joints crackling and
popping with his motions. One of his legs seems entirely useless,
hanging limply from his hip. His eyes bear much sadness, but he seems
quite wise to the ways of Dragon Isle.

A fighter
This is a young fighter, drawn to the Isle by the promises of adventure
and treasure.  He brandishes his dagger about in an unexperienced
manner, showing off and trying to seem important.

Bron, the Blacksmith of Dragon Isle
Bron is a tall, burly man with long, frizzled steel-grey hair.  His skin
has been burnished to a coppery sheen by his long hours at the forge,
the copper colour in stark contrast to his deep blue eyes.  He is quite
massive, his muscles strengthened by the hard labour that he has made
his life.  It is said that none can best him at his specialty, crafting
armour from the hide and scales of dragons. He could probably teach you
a lot about armour.

A large gator   184
This large reptile has extremely large teeth set in a long snout.  It is
an eating machine, its massive jaws snapping with enough power to sever
the heads of small animals.  Beware, it has its sights set on you!

An ogre   8192
This ogre is a large humanoid, standing almost 10 feet tall.  He remains
perfectly still as he stares at you coldly, waiting for you to show any
sign of aggression.

A <gender> Stone Giant   6636
This is a <gender> Stone Giant, standing about 10 feet tall.  He/She is very
large and strong, his/her features seeming craggy like the stone of the
earth.  His/her skin is dusky grey in colour, and he/she reminds you of nothing
more than a large, animated pile of stone.

The Stone Giant Chief

Sxithia, the Mother of Black Dragons   316286
Sxithia is the eldest black dragon on Dragon Isle, and the mother to
most of the others.  Her serpentine body is covered in black scales, the
colour of reminding you of decayed plants and the muck of the swamp.
Her luminescent eyes are the only coloured part of her, glowing bright
and malevolent green.  She is evil, but not vicious, watching you warily
for signs of violence.  You would be wise not to anger her.

Sha'anikaar, the Mother of Sand Dragons    248989
At first, Sha'anikaar seems to be a mass of living sand, rising from the
ground and shaking off the sand she had buried herself in.  Her dusty
tan hide is mottled and dull, to hide better on the beach in which she
makes her home.  She is truly massive, the most ancient of sand dragons
on Dragon Isle, and the mother of most of them.

Zzylia, the Violet Faerie Dragon   63779
Zzylia is a curious creature, about the size of a large dog.  Her skin
is a deep violet, her eyes a clear blue, her butterfly wings every
colour in between.  She looks just like her dragon kin, albeit much
smaller. You can see intelligence and mischief in this charming
creature.

Cherstil, the Green Faerie Dragon   65747
Cherstil is small, flitting about you anxiously to look at you from all
angles.  His size can be deceiving, though, for he is more intelligent
than most humans.  His claws are very sharp, glistening black with a
tint of green.  His skin is a deep green, contrasting nicely with his
yellow eyes.  His goassamer-thin wings are patterned in both colours.
He looks very much like a miniature dragon with butterfly wings.

Chlorritia, the Mother of Green Dragons    304304
Chlorritia glares at you with glowing yellow eyes, her sheer size making
you gasp and draw back.  Her eyes are each larger than your head, her
wings look like they could completely block out the sun, should she
choose to spread them.  Her scales are every colour of green imaginable,
from green so deep it seems black to the lightest chartreuse, the darker
scales on her top and the lighter scales on her belly.  She is the most
ancient of green dragons on Dragon Isle, and is mother to most of the
rest.

Spiri, the Blue Faerie Dragon   68032
Spiri is a small, strange creature, resembling a miniature dragon.  Her
skin is patterned with different shades of blue, from lightest sky blue
to deepest azure. Her eyes a clear violet, matching the patterns on her
gossamer thin butterfly wings. You can see intelligence and mischief
twinkling in the eyes of this charming creature.

Byrontiqua, the Mother of Blue Dragons    369272
Byrontiqua lays here, her tail coiled around her.  Her long forked
tongue flickers from between her massive teeth, giving off small streaks
of static electricity.  Her scales are a clear deep blue, hardened by
the centuries she has lived and grown in knowledge and power.  She eyes
you with scorn, as if she does not consider you worthy of the air you
breathe.

Saoirse, the Shadow Dragon    366947
Lurking in the shadows, Saoirse glares at you with luminous eyes.  You
cannot judge the full mass of her body, as she seems to be made from the
shadows themselves, but you are left with the impression of a huge body.
You can detect the writhing coils of her tail lashing around in the
shadows, showing her irritation with your presence in her lair. Take
care not to make her angry, for she is a deadly adversary.

Tyhhra, the Mother of White Dragons   300347
Tyhhra is a truly ancient dragon, her lifespan measure in centuries,
with no end in sight.  Her teeth are as long as your arms, her pale
ice-blue eyes the size of shield.  Her breath is the cold north wind
able to steal the heat from living things.  She is the eldest of all the
white dragons on Dragon Isle, and mother to most of them. She is evil,
but not vicious, only attacking to protect her hoarde.

Sslyra, the Mother of Red Dragons   301834
Sslyra is an ancient dragon, her life measured in centuries rather than
years.  She coils around her hoarde, her scales glistening in every
colour of red that you could imagine, from the deep crimson of the dried
blood of a murdered child to the vermillion of the sun settting over a
battlefield.  She is the eldest red dragon on Dragon Isle, and the
mother to many of them.

Byrontic the blue dragon (Evil)    945354
Byrontic, the infamous blue dragon, is coiled here, little sparks of
electricity racing through his scales and across his claws.  He watches
you warily, seeming to search you for something with his ancient eyes.
You have heard many rumours about this fantastic being, tales of his
evil ways and many conquests, but you have never heard that he was
cruel.  He has lived for centuries, growing in power and wisdom.  Speak
with him carefully, for you surely risk your life by intruding on his
lair.

Euryla, the Mother of Cave Dragons    390774
Euryla looks as though she was formed from the bones of the earth
itself, her massive pale body almost completely filling this cavern.
She moves almost lazily, her immense muscles moving menacingly beneath
her smooth scales, but you get the impression that she could move
frighteningly fast if she were threatened.  She is the most ancient of
the cave dragons on Dragon Isle, and the mother to most of them.

Piristin, the Black Faerie Dragon    65564
Piristin is small, no larger than a large dog, but his size is
deceptive, for he can be quite deadly if he chooses.  His claws are
razor sharp, the same glistening black as his dark skin.  His eyes are
clear violet, and his butterfly wings patterned with both colours.  He
looks very much like a miniature dragon, and just as menacing.






Ancient <Color> Dragon Scales
These are the scales of a <color> dragon.  Judging by the size and quality
of the scales, you think it came from a ancient dragon.  If you took it
to the smithy on Dragon Isle, perhaps you could get it made into armour.

Shimmering Octachromatic Dragon Armour
This suit of armour is impressive, made with the scales of ancient
dragons of each of the eight kinds of dragons on Dragon Isle.  This
suit, however, seems to be imbued with more than just the protective
aspects of the dragon scales.  A subtle shimmer in the scales plays with
the light, slowly shifting between the eight colours of the incorporated
scales.
