M'sieur Firmin   7741
A thin man in a finely tailored suit.  The small lapel pin shows
he is a master of the Academy of Music, and probably the manager of
the opera house.

M'sieur Armand   8041
A short man in a suit, obviously not a patron of the theatre.  The
small lapel pin shows he is a master of the Academy of Music, and
probably the manager of the opera house.

Mame Giry   5643
A short woman in a black dress.  She holds a small pad in one
hand, which she consults often.  She's obviously the concierge of
the opera house, and busy getting people to their seats for the show.

An actor   2723
A man in costume, preparing to sing in the opening of the opera.
He is tall and muscular, and dressed as a common laborer.

Carlotta   9684
A striking woman advancing in years, Carlotta seems to be clinging
to her position as lead actress in the Academy of Music.  Her smile
is cold, as are her eyes.  She may be a great opera star, but she's
definitely not a nice person.

Christine Daae   11573
Christine glances up at you with her deep blue eyes, a hint of
tired anxiety within them.  Her golden hair frames an angelic face
showing signs of recent worry.  She is already in costume for her
first act tonight as a serving girl.

A large brown rat   73
A disgusting rat.  It's about a foot long with beady little eyes
that glow in the dark.

The Phantom of the Opera   25476
Two red eyes glow with fire behind the white mask covering this
man's face.  He stands clothed in an immaculate tuxedo, with silver
and opal cufflinks.  He carries a length of rope in one hand, and
does not appear to be happy to see you.





An accounts ledger
A large leather bound book which appears to weigh quite a bit.

a jeweled hairbrush
A large ebony handled hair brush with ivory inlays in swirling
patterns.

A diamond engagement ring
A thin banded diamond engagement ring.  The stone is fantastically
cut, and glitters in the light.

A richly embroidered cloak
A dark cloak, nearly black in color, with red and gold embroidery
along the edges.  It looks very warm.

A white mask
A white mask molded in the likeness of a face.  It's smooth features
are eerie and its luminous finish only adds to the strange presence
the mask brings.

a coiled length of rope
A length of rope coiled neatly.  A large sliding loop is spliced
into one end of the rope, this must be the ghost's legendary punjab
lasso!
