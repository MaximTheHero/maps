  To whom it may concern,

  If you found this note, then I must of pushed my luck too far.  Be leery
  of this gun.  Its treasures are wondrous, but also very addicting.  It
  would seem to pull you out of the worst of situations, but really what
  its doing is gaining your trust, and luring you in.  Soon, you'll find
  yourself dependant on it.  Unable to stop.  An addiction that I have
  fallen to.

  I was once nobody.  Now I'm rich and powerful.  None of it means
  anything now.  As I am dead.  Heed my warning.  If you find this devil
  cursed weapon, toss it aside.  Don't fall into the trap that I have been
  caught in.

  At least in death my soul is freed.

  Sincerely,


  A dead man

Colt .45 Revolver.
A old colt revolver like the ones found in the old west.  The gun
appears to be a collectable or antique of some sort, and you figure
probably wouldn't do well in an actual combat situation.  Something
seems strange about the gun, but it is in remarkably good condition.
You notice that there is a single bullet in the chamber, and the handle
has an inscription engraved within it.

  Beware:  A curse shall inhabit the owner of whomever possesses this
  weapon.  Few have been lucky enough to escape the curse, as the greed of
  all men cause their eventual downfall.  If luck be with you, and you
  wish to try, then spin the chamber and pull the trigger, and see what
  luck shall bring ye.
