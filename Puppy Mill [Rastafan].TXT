Daisy-mae the harlot
This is Daisy-mae.  She's Rocko's wife.  You know this because she has
'Rocko's Wife' branded onto her forehead.  You also know she's a
harlot because it's tattooed on her cheek.  Regardless, she's uglier
than a baboon with the mange.

Some moron with a lead pipe
This is some slack-jawed, squinty-eyed moron carrying around a lead
pipe.  Don't even try to reason with him, he has no idea what words
are.

Rocko the redneck
This is Rocko the redneck.  You know this because he has 'Rocko'
tattooed on his fingers.  (He had to put the 'k' and' 'o' together on
his pinky because you couldn't see his thumb from above.)
