Fort Guard    15228
The fort guard is a highly trained knight at the ready in a suit of
full platemail.  His movements are calculated and his years of
military training are evident.  The knights sturdy long sword is ready
to slice whatever rabble gets in his way.  It would probably be best
to keep your nose clean around him.

Horse    5749
A large horse that plays in the stables of the knights fort.  The
horse grazes and runs around the pen.  Even through it seems harmless
enough, the powerful muscles that ripple as it walks tells you that
the horse is very strong.




Knight's Sword
A well polished sword.  A couple scratches on the blade tell you it's
been well used in the past, but the sword is still in good enough to
use to protect yourself.

Knight Platemail
A sturdy set of platemail armour.  While offering good protection,
sneaking anywhere in this clanking armour would be impossible.
Several scrapes and scratches show you that this armour has been well
used in the past.
