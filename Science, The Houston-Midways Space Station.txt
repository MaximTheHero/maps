1: Kirsten the Midways barkeep.


Monsters:

2611 : A lynx stalking its prey

A small feline stalking something through the trees.  The small cat 
is barely larger than a common housecat, apparently adjusting to 
the smaller environment of the station.  It barely pays you any 
notice as it slinks through the trees towards some unseen target.


1386 : A python lying in ambush
771 : A python lying in ambush
287 : A python lying in ambush

You've stumbled across one of the more dangerous members of the 
gardens.  The python appears to be a rather small one, maybe only 
nine feet long (good thing you didn't step on it).  Its tongue 
flicks out to catch the scent of approaching prey, you feel 
confident that you're not it, unless you provoke it of course.


176 : A chirping sparrow

A small sparrow, brought here from Earth to liven up the gardens.  
The species has adapted very well to the artificial gravity and 
simulated night and day.  The small bird chitters away, oblivious 
to your presence.


78 : A red tailed squirrel

A small red tailed squirrel nervously looks your way as it 
forrages for food.  It's smal hand-like paws shift through the 
grass in search of fallen nuts or other food.  Every time you 
move, it crouches, ready to sprint.  Apparantly mother nature 
doesn't release her hold on things even in space.


312 : An iguana lounging on a branch

The light green skin of the iguana blends nicely with the leaves 
surrounding it, nearly hiding it from your view.  This is yet 
another of the transplanted creatures which has been found to 
thrive in the artificial environment of the station.  As you watch 
it it calmly moves further down the branch on its daily hunt.


22934 : A space marine

This is one of the fabled space marines.  These incredible 
physical specimens are trained rigorously for any duty off of 
Earth.  These men are charged to keep the peace within the 
Martian colony until it has been established that it can support 
its own police force.


842 : A primly dressed secretary

An attractive woman dressed in a conservative business suit.  The 
darkened rings about her eyes are skillfully hidden beneath her 
heavy makeup, though you can see the long workday is taking its 
toll.  Still, she seems industrious enough and will probably work 
her way out of this menial job soon enough.


29177 : Angela Myers, the Midways station exec

A tired looking woman with little sense of humor.  Her demeanor makes 
it obvious that she's the one in charge here, and she's not going to 
give up her position easily.  I wouldn't cross this woman.  That's 
the last thing you need, a powerful woman ticked at you.


6016 : A Midways technician

A slip of a woman in baggy Midways coveralls.  She appears to 
be on her way someplace, probably to assist in an inspection or 
deliver reports.  Her determined stride gives you a sense of 
confidence that the station workers are actually concerned with 
keeping the place running.


6016 : A corporate wage slave

A nearly frantic looking corporate stooge.  You can't imagine what 
would have someone so worried looking up here on the space station; 
that is unless it's about to fall apart.  These folks definately 
can't be getting paid what they're worth if this person's dedication 
is any indication.


6016 : A genetic engineer

An anemic looking guy in a lab coat.  He seems absorbed in 
his own work and barely pays you any notice.  He actually 
seems a little irate that you're here at all.  Maybe you'd 
better get out of his way.


5993 : A weary station worker

A tired looking man wearing coveralls emblazoned with the Midways 
logo.  He seems to be taking a break from his work to lounge about 
for a while.  You can only hope that what he's supposed to be 
fixing isn't essential to keeping the space station safe.


7256 : A retiree enjoying his free time

A recently retired man looking like he's finally enjoying his 
life.  He seems to be slightly overwhelmed by the sheer enormity 
of the space station, spending more of his time looking about him 
than at where he's walking.


3070 : A haggard looking traveler

A tired looking man in a treadbare overcoat.  He seems to be 
some kind of low level executive, or perhaps an office lackey 
on vacation off planet.  You think about it and decide this is 
probably the result of this man's last four years of work, blowing 
his whole savings on this one offworld trip.


7668 : A weary looking man

A weary looking man in a jumpsuit sprouting the Midways logo.  Of 
course, half the people here are sporting some sort of Midways 
logo, being one of the many people living here to maintain the huge 
station.  He looks rather over worked and probably feels under paid.


5993 : A tired woman sorely in need of her vacation

This haggard woman looks like she's probably an executive 
secretary or other office wage slave.  She seems restless and 
eagar to move on to her final destination and begin that long 
awaited vacation.


7668 : A haggard looking traveler

A tired looking man in a treadbare overcoat.  He seems to be 
some kind of low level executive, or perhaps an office lackey 
on vacation off planet.  You think about it and decide this is 
probably the result of this man's last four years of work, blowing 
his whole savings on this one offworld trip.


1512 : A vr junkie

An anemic looking teenager with sunken eyes and a nervous twitch.  
This guy's got the classic symptoms of addiction to virtual reality 
systems.  He's probably hanging around the arcade in the hopes of 
getting someone to hook him up with his fix.


6846 : A respectible looking station worker

A rather respectable looking man dressed in a casual business 
clothes.  He appears to be someone of some importance, probably a 
shift supervisor or an office manager for the mining corps.


13916 : A drunken station worker

An unshaven man in a Midways jumpsuit stares at you through glazed 
eyes as he cradles his beer in his hands.  His lips move silently, 
muttering words that only he can hear.  He definately seems to want 
to be alone.


20264 : A burly looking man

A huge man sporting a jacket emblazoned with the Midways logo.  
You're not quite sure what he does to keep fit up here, but it's 
definately working.  Even with that beer in his hand you're pretty 
sure he'd be a tough fight.  Probably shouldn't mess with him.


337 : A rastafarian

This is the nappiest looking guy you have EVER seen. Dude's got
big, funky dreadlocks and this crust around his eyes. What's
that thing he's smoking?



Items:
A suit of body armour.
A suit of body armour which is standard issue to the Space Marines. 
It's a high density polymer with plenty of padding beneath it.  It 
is enameled in a metallic substance for protection from the energy 
weapons so common in their line of work.  It seems light and durable.

A pair of combat boots.
A pair of standard issue combat boots.  The best synthetic leather 
and lightest soles make them rather durable and comfortable to wear.

A plasma rifle.
A compact weapon which appears to be cast from plastic.  It's 
power source is lodged in the pistol grip, and seems to be nearly 
infinite.  This is the standard issue weapon of the Space Marines.

An electrified net.
A large net made of silvery monofilament wire.  Each
is the perfect conductor of electricity.  The net
acts like a taser, attacking a person's nervous sustem
and rendering them easier to subdue.

A designer business suit.
A stylish designer business suit made from silk harvested in 
zero gravity.  You aren't quite sure why that makes the silk 
any different, but it's the in thing lately, and it's obvious 
that they're selling well.

A pair of workboots.
A pair of silvery boots.  They appear to be coated with 
monofilaments of aluminium or similar metal to provide a heat 
shield when working on the exterior of the Midways station.

An environmental suit.
An environmental suit used for work in harsh conditions such as 
the void of space.  The suit is rather bulky and looks like it'd 
be difficult to move about in.  The shuttle and moon logo of the 
Midways station is stitches into the suit's breast.

A black briefcase.
An aging briefcase of synthetic leather.  The clasps are beginning 
to lose their gold paint, and the handle looks like it's beginning 
to tear a bit.

An id card.
A flimsy piece of plastic with a small magnetic strip and bar code 
along one end and the Midways logo scrawled across the face of the 
card.  It's not much to look at, but surely carries a great deal of 
information.

A large wooden crate.
A large wooden crate still wrapped with metal straps and nailed shut.
The splintered wooden boards of the crate are scarred where the shipping
stencils were, leaving no indication of what was in, or might still be
in the boxes.

A white lab coat.
A white lab coat often worn to keep a laboratory free of dirt that 
a person might carry in with them.  It doesn't seem all the useful 
for anything else.

Heavy work gloves.
A pair of heavy canvas work gloves.  They appear to have seen 
extensive use, showing signs of burns and tears along thier palms 
and fingers.  They're fairly comfortable though, you can understand 
why they're still being used.

A military style duffle.
A bag of sturdy olive colored canvas.  It looks like it'll hold 
a great deal of stuff in it.  Then again, I'm sure that's why the 
military issues them to people.

A tattered overcoat.
A tattered looking overcoat that seems to have seen much better 
days.  The garment looks warm and especially protective in the 
rain.  Of course, the acid laced rainfall on Earth probably are 
responsible for it looking like it does.

A wide brimmed hat.
A soft felt wide brimmed hat.  It seems to be in relatively good 
shape, probably finding very little use.  It's a rather stylish 
looking thing, really rather striking in the soft off white.

A pair of gloves.
A delicate pair of gloves made from some synthetic leather.  They 
appear to be entirely too thin for anything but decoration.

A VR helmet.
A fully functional virtual reality helmet.  This is a deluxe model 
complete with speakers and the optional neural interface.  A small 
power jack is seated in the back of the helmet next to a data 
slot.  The helmet completely isolates a person's senses of sight 
and hearing.  I wouldn't recommend wearing one while driving.

A grey jumpsuit.
A grey jumpsuit of very thick material.  A patch with the Midways 
logo is sewn just above the breast pocked and another across the 
back of the suit.  The material seems very resistant to tear and is 
probably very useful when working in tight places to keep from 
getting scrapse and cuts.

A roach.
The roach from a joint. You don't have a lighter, but you could eat it.

A jacket made of hemp.
A jacket made from hemp. The rastafarian's probably cold now.

A peace pipe.
This wooden pipe is beautiful. It has ivory inlays, and hits so
smooth. No wonder the rastafarian loved it so much!
