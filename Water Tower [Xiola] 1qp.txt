Monsters:
A tower guard    8299
This is one of the men enlisted to guard the water tower. His crew
cut has grown into a mangled mess of hair, and his face hasn't seen
a razor for several weeks. The scorching surrounds have left him with
a permanent squint and he looks you up and down with obvious distrust.

The force leader   27017
This is the force leader. He is a large muscular man with a dirty
sweat soaked bandana wrapped around his head. He has a haunted look
in his eyes, echoing the horrors he has witnessed.
