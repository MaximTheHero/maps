1: buy ticket (100g)
2: give ticket to clerk
3: enter - to ring


A clerk   8254
This clerk is waiting for your ticket.  Without a ticket, you can't get
into the stadium.  He looks wimpy, but you don't think you should kill
him.  After all, how will you get into the stadium then?

An angry crowd member    7174
This badass crowd member has slicked hair and is wearing layers of gold
chains.  He's obviously here to see some ass get kicked.  Now that he's
spotted you though, it's YOUR ass he wants to kick!

A policeman   12823
The policeman is here to quell any disturbances.  He's carrying a brutal
looking club, and you DON'T think you should mess with him.

Pete Gas    10202
Pete Gas, a close childhood friend of Shane McMahon, makes up one third
of the group known as the Mean Street Posse. Subjected to enormous
privation, Gas grew up on the mean streets of Greenwich, Connecticut
and can only be described as smug and hateable. He also has one of the
worst win-loss records in Federation history. Go on. Put him out of
everybody's misery.

Jerry 'The King' Lawler   11149
Lawler began his career in the 1970s in Memphis, and soon became one
of the most hated grapplers in various southern territories. He was
the Stone Cold of that time, defeating such stars as Ric Flair, Hulk
Hogan and Terry Funk for numerous titles. His piledriver ended many a
career, and officials once tried to get it banned because of its
crippling effects. Today, Lawler is a household name not for his
title wins, but for his notorious run-ins with late comedian Andy
Kaufman in the early 1980s. In the early 1990s, Lawler ventured to
the World Wrestling Federation and went on to become part of the
Federation broadcasting team on RAW, although he still dons his ring
attire from time to time!

Chyna   16396
Chyna first entered the World Wrestling Federation as Triple H's
valet, but has since struck out on her own. Refusing to compete
in the Women's Division, she has achieved numerous accolades such as
being the first woman to compete in the King of The Ring and Royal
Rumble competitions, and is the first ever female Intercontinental
champion. She is afraid of no one and more than able to hold her own
in the ring against any opponent.

Taka   17130
Taka is an exceptionally small Japanese man, best known in the WWF for
being its first ever Light-Heavyweight Champion. He is renowned as a
daredevil high-flyer and is certainly not to be taken lightly, despite
his small stature. Along with Funaki, he represents the Japanese
wrestling stable Kaientai.

British Bulldog   17778
It's the British Bulldog!  He has returned from his sidelining
injury and is determined to capture the only prize that has eluded him
his entire life - the Federation Championship! Since his return, he has
abandoned his flamboyant Union Jack-bedecked outfit in favour of jeans
and combat boots, and his technical high-flying style in favour of good,
old-fashioned, kicking the hell out of his opponents.

X-Pac   19794
This is X-Pac!  This spectacular wrestler might not be the largest
in the ring, but his speed more than makes up for it.  This rebel,
formerly known as the 1-2-3 Kid, traded in the fresh face for a beard
and sunglasses and an attitude!

Grand Master Sexay    21736
Grand Master Sexay and his tag team partner Scotty Too Hotty have
taken the World Wrestling Federation by storm. Not only are they
one of the most successful tag teams currently competing in the
Federation, but they are easily one of the most popular, as well.
Alongside Rikishi Phatu, Too Cool always get the crowd on its feet
with their highly popular dance routine. Clearly, their "hood"
appearance and electrifying dance moves have made them winners in
the hearts of the fans. But their athleticism has made them winners
in the ring. Grand Master Sexay and Scotty Too Hotty are two of the
most talented Superstars competing today.

Scotty Too Hotty   21538

Ken Shamrock   19211
This is Ken Shamrock, the former Ultimate Fighting Championship Superfight
Champion. He used to ply his trade in the Octagon, but now battles under
the auspices of the World Wrestling Federation. He rejoices in the title
'The World's Most Dangerous Man', and that reputation was by no means
lightly gained. Be very, very careful around him, he is prone to snap.

Chris Benoit 26040
There is little doubt among those who have followed his career that Chris
Benoit is one of the most skilled technical wrestlers to ever compete in
sports entertainment. His style, which sometimes resembles art more than
wrestling, has earned him accolades all over the world in the past decade.
Now Chris Benoit's journey to the top has ended right where it should -
on top, in the World Wrestling Federation. There is no doubt that this
young man has already proven he can achieve extraordinary things inside
the squared circle, and now that he's with the WWF, his career may hit
heights few have seen before.

Chris Jericho   22580
It's Chris Jericho!  His arrogant stance above you helps you realize
that perhaps this young upstart is here to save the Federation.  The
Ayatollah of Rock and Roll-a has come to save the day, and ruin yours.

Andre the Giant (undead)   73522
This is the ancient god of wrestling, Andre the Giant.  He is so huge,
he takes up the entire ring.  Not a normal man, Andre has a physical
defect that made him grow larger than most.  You don't know whether
to bow down to him or to run up and shave off his viscious sideburns.
Nobody messed with him when he was alive, and you'd be a fool to mess
with him now that he's dead.
