Zombie    96013
This pathetic creature has nothing but a stump for a left arm.  It
looks like he may have chewed off the rest of it in his desperation
for the taste of human flesh.  He now walks the halls of Aegis Global
mindlessly seeking more flesh to devour.

Aegis Sentry Model 60-FT     117088
A product of Aegis Global, this sentry robot is programmed to protect
and serve.  It appears the robot's logic matrix has been tampered
with, as it shouldn't be aggressive to humans.  It stands over seven
feet tall and moves on roto-cylinders that resemble the wheel
mechanism of a military tank.  It is armed with a flame thrower and a
tear gas grenade launcher.

Aegis Sentry Model 62-CC    187581
Another fine product of Aegis Global, this sentry robot is programmed
for crowd control.  Typically, it would only fire rubber bullets upon
aggressive personnel, but it looks like someone has overridden its
logic matrix and upgraded its arsenal.  It stands over seven feet tall
and moves on roto-cylinders.  It is armed with two machine guns and
has belts of armor-piercing ammunition hanging from its sides.

Aegis Sentry Model 64-CC   275948
This product of Aegis Global is a sentry robot with enhanced fire
power for anti-theft and security precautions.  It boasts upgraded
armor plating that is resistant to almost all forms of attack and a
faster processor than earlier models for better response times.  It
stands over seven feet tall and moves on roto-cylinders.  It is armed
with two flame throwers and has a selection of high-powered grenades.

Aegis Sentry Model 65-SE  216047
This advanced sentry-model is one of the latest innovations to come
out of the labs of Aegis Global.  Sleek in design, it moves with
lethal grace on its roto-cylinders as it prowls whatever rooms it is
set to monitor.  With its advanced arsenal of auto-loading machine
guns and array of grenades, this robot is built to subdue virtually
all forms of biological opposition.  It stands over seven feet in
height and its reinforced steel plating gleams in the fluorescent
light as it moves silently around the building.

Aegis Soldier Model 66-SO   362078
One of the more lethal Aegis Global products, this robot is a killing
machine.  It stands slightly taller than a man but is made of
reinforced steel and probably weighs over a ton.  It rolls silently
though the building on its roto-cylinder base and has a guidance
system that allows it to track anything that moves or makes the
slightest of sounds.  It wields two massive auto-loading machine guns
and an array of grenades.  This metallic menace is capable of
destroying just about anything it comes across.  You might want to get
out of its way.  Quickly.

Aegis Assembler Model 68-AS   408479
This monstrous robot stands well over eight feet tall and is as big as
a tank.  Built to work on the assembly lines of Aegis Global, its size
is necessary in order to have the power to manipulate the heavy parts
used to build other robots and weapons.  It's made from steel and
temperature resistant polymers and moves very slowly across the floor
on its massive roto-cylinder base.  It has four arm-like extensions.
One resembles a huge hammer, one looks like a giant set of pincers,
another seems to be a built-in blow torch and the last one is some
sort of electric wand.  Normally disinterested in humans, it now
appears to be programmed to use these arms as weapons against anything
human that it comes in contact with.

Aegis Guardian Model 66-GU      889038
Manufactured to survive virtually all forms of attack, this robot is
nearly indestructible.  As the most expensive of the Aegis Global
product line these robots are rarely seen, but touted by their owners
as the very best in protection.  Standing at seven feet tall and
bearing a host of weapons, this titanium alloy killing machine has
apparently been programmed to kill all intruders in the building.  You
probably ought to run.  Chances of surviving a battle with this thing
are very slim.

Calvin Mechler      68915

Aegis Genocide Trooper       1146407
This top secret robot has never been seen by the public and for good
reason.  Developed under Calvin Mechler's direct supervision, this
trooper has been designed for one purpose: The destruction of the
human race.  Swift, strong, and nearly indestructible, this robot
wields an array of weapons, and is protected by both the very best in
armours as well as an energy field that deflects most damage types.
Once it's armed with its tetrodoxmaphin bombs, it will be released
into the general population to carry out its apocalyptic mission.  Now
you're the only one that can stop it!



Items:
Tear gas canister
This tear gas canister can be used as a grenade if tossed at an
enemy.  Although only about five inches long, the light green
cylinder packs a mean punch if used against anything that isn't
immune to poison.

Nerve gas canister.
This nerve gas canister can be used as a grenade if tossed at an
enemy.  Although only about five inches long, the bright yellow
cylinder packs a mean punch if used against anything that isn't
immune to nerve agents.

Aegis Global level 7 clearance passcard.
This plastic passcard provides access to the CEO's office in the
Aegis Global underground complex.  It has a metallic stripe on one
side that must be swiped at the proper door.

360 ammo belt.
This long belt of ammunition is meant to be loaded in an MH-360
assault rifle.  The belt can hold a ton of bullets and these shells
are special.  They each hold a tiny microchip that guides them toward
a target for maximum efficiency.  This ammo is made for serious
combat.  Use it wisely.
A digital counter on the side displays the number "10000"

MH-360 Assault Rifle (enhanced).
This belt-fed machine gun is relatively light in weight, but it
utilizes a revolutionary type of ammunition that hardly ever jams and
carries a small microchip in every round.  These 'smart bullets' are
self guided, making aiming a breeze.  This gun is the very latest
innovation in handheld arms from Aegis Global and is capable of doling
out a vast amount of carnage.

Mechler's Eye.
Disgusting!  This detached eyeball seems to have been ripped out
of the head of Aegis Global's CEO, Calvin Mechler.  God only knows
why anyone would want this foul souvenir.
It looks light.
