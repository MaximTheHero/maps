-----------------------------------------------------------------
Vilanthia, the witch.
Vilanthia has lived on this island for centuries, using the local plants
and animals as ingredients in her potions and items. Her hair flows down
her back, bright silver in colour. Her face has an ageless look to it, a
product of her enchantments. Dressed in a simple brown robe, she doesn't
seem all that imposing, but you still get a strange feeling of power
from her...

You say: potion
Vilanthia whispers: Yes, I can brew many different types.
                    I need the ingredients first.

You say: ingredients
Vilanthia whispers: The ingredients depend on what it is
                    you are trying to brew. The easiest
                    potions are potions of heroism and
                    oil of burning.

Vilanthia whispers: The fresh corpse of a tree viper, together
                    with a flask of water will allow me to create
                    a potion of heroism.

Vilanthia whispers: Oil of burning require the scale
                    from a forest drake, as well as the tongue
                    from a firenewt.
