Undead Lich     140487
The undead lich before you is cloaked in grayish-blue robes.  His
desiccated body has withered to a skeletal form and icy-blue
electricity flickers along his arms.  His skeletal hand clutches a
rod-like septer with a glowing blue gem at the top.

Undead Werebeast     127368
The cloaked figure that stumbles before you is a grotesque
representation of a human.  The cloak flows down the length of its
body, thankfully covering up the rotted out mass underneath.  Under
its cowl you see a rotted skull.  Looking closer, you notice that the
rotted skull is not human.  It is in the form of a canine.

Undead Vampire   142586
The decomposing female vampire that stands before you in no way
resembles the beauty she once was.  Her skin has rotted into leathery
strips that hang on her bones.  Her dark clothing hangs off her in
tattered pieces.  The only thing about her that remains one hundred
percent intact are her sharp fangs.

Undead Reaper    154678
The undead creature before you is a true horror to look upon.  He is
covered in black flowing robes and his head is covered with a black
cowl.  You see two glowing red eyes staring out at you from underneath
the hood.  His skeletal hand clutches a razor-sharp scythe.

Undead Ghost     129568
The decaying corpse that stands before you flickers in and out of
view.  It is cloaked in shabby rotted robes that drape down its form
and drag on the ground.

Undead Mummy     130244
The mummy that stands before you is covered with decaying bandages.
Magical black flames flicker along his body and his eyes glow a deep
fire-red.  His head is covered with a Nemes style headdress that
covers the top of his head and drapes down the sides.



Necromancer Rod
This is an artifact which necromancers use to focus their magical energies.  It has a metal
prong structure at the end where a gem or stone may once have been. The prongs are bent a bit
and the stone is missing.

Tattered Robe
This cowled black robe is tattered and rotted.  It is made to cover
the full length of a human body, and hide the owner's skull inside its
deep cowl.

shred of birch bark
A shred of white bark from a birch tree.

acorn
An acorn from a Black Oak tree.
