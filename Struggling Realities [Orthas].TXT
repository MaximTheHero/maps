A small flashing nibbler (mutator)    338
The nibbler is chewing at the edges of reality, small changes to the
composition of its immediate environment can be seen as it feeds. It
is difficult to see exactly how the nibbler looks as it changes in
appearance with every bite it takes. It is pretty small.

An oily bobbler (mutator)   339
The bobbler looks like a big oily bubble with three smaller bubbles
attached. Two of the smaller bobbles seem to serve as eyes, and the
third looks a bit like a nose. Bubbles frequently fly from the
nose-like bubble. The large bubble of this semi-transparent creature
is about half full of something that looks like water with bubbles on
top. It is pretty small.

A small squeeler (mutator)   338
The squeeler looks like a velvet frog with a hole on its back. A
high-pitched sound originates from this hole. The sound seems to
distort the air like heat ripples. It is pretty small.



A feathery gobler (mutator)
The gobler is a bird-like being. It has long orange legs with a clumsy
feathery body on top. There is a beak and two beady eyes on the front
of the body. It would probably be easy to kill.

A feathery hobler (mutator)
The hobler is a sturdy looking quadropod with leathery grey skin. It
has blue feathers protruding from its skin along its spine. An orange
mane of feathers covers most of its head making it impossible to see
its facial features. It would probably be easy to kill.

A red topler (mutator)
This quadropod is covered in colourful red feathers, except for the
head which looks like a horses head with a short creme-coloured mane.
It would probably be easy to kill.
