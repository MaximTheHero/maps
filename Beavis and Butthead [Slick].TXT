Beavis is here picking his nose    4933
Wearing a dark blue Metallica shirt and grey shorts, this babbling idiot
should be in a mental home. His blondish hair suits his mentality. He is
fairly skinny, probably from all the nachos he eats. The evidence is on
his shirt. He has a VERY prominant jaw.

Butthead is standing here, scratching his butt    3940
This has got to be one of the ugliest people you have ever seen. He is a
skinny boy with braces, and dark unkempt hair. He is wearing a blue
shirt emblazoned with AC/DC, and red shorts. Constantly laughing to
himself, he must be mentally unbalanced, or just plain stupid.

Stewart wants to come out of the closet now    7817
One of Beavis and Buttheads 'friends', Stewart looks out of place here,
being reasonably normal. He has short dark hair, and a black shirt and
shorts to match. He is a little chubby, so either he eats well, or he's
just big boned.

Cornholio, the Almighty Bunghole
This guy looks kinda like Beavis, except for the fact that his shirt is
pulled over his head, and his arms are constantly raised, as if he were
being held up or something. There is a tiny bit of blondish hair poking
out from underneath the shirt, and there are some letters on his shirt,
but you can't make them out.




An AC/DC shirt
A dark blue shirt emblazoned with the letters AC/DC. It is very casual
looking.

An empty can of Jolt Cola
A small red and black can with the words Jolt Cola written on it. In
smaller letters beside that it reads : Twice the Caffeine of Coke. Pity
it's empty, you could do probably do with a caffeine burst to keep you
going.
