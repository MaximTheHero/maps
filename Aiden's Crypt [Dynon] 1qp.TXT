Aiden Tremayne, Fallen Prince of the Clan Dracul   211661
Before you stands the awe inspiring form of Aiden Tremayne, Highlord
and Prince of the once great Clan Dracul.  This fallen leader of the
undead armies has remained banished to this dark hole of centuries.
Even from his stone tomb he has never ceased his plots for revenge
against the people who had trapped him here.  Even now he paces with
dark thoughts on his mind. Do you dare interrupt his brooding
meditation?




The Obsidian Rapier (ensharpened)
The sleek, obsidian blade shimmers with an unholy power.  The basketed
hilt is made of perfectly-crafted strands of polished silver steel.  The
strands have been forged into an elegant design centering on an obsidian
plaque.  The plaque contains a deep etching of the dragon symbol of the
ancient Clan Dracul.  A delicately woven crimson thread winds its way up
the handle ensuring a firm grasp on this unholy weapon.  The pommel
contains another large obsidian stone cut into a perfect spherical
ellipse. The stone has been set into a silver, dragon-clawed setting
acting as a perfect balance for a virtually weightless feel.

A small obsidian pearl
It is unlike any pearl you have seen before.

Obsidian Marble
Exquisitely crafted/magicked, this pristine little obsidian bauble is
the whimsical, residual aftermath of peeronic thought.  Sadly, the
entropic tendencies of such mental energies are difficult to grasp or
maintain.  A marble will inevitably evanesce and reform in an infinite
number of cryptic locations.
