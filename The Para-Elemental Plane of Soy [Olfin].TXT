1: clear barricade

Miso Elemental    37863
The Miso Elemental is a writhing mass of fermented soy paste, roughly
the height of a human, but much wider.  Its features shift and blur
constantly, flowing slowly, yet continually into new forms.  It
burbles and gurgles as it flows around, exercising some bizarre,
seemingly impossible form of locomotion.

Tofudebeest     36041
This curious creature looks somewhat like a type of antelope, except
that it is composed entirely of firm tofu cut at right angles, giving
it an awkward, blocky appearance.  Long, curving horns protrude from
its cuboid head.  Despite its feeble appearance, you suspect that the
Tofudebeest could defend itself quite well.

Tofu Storm Trooper      46062
Squat and portly, the Tofu Storm Trooper presents a solid obstacle.
About as tall as a human child, the trooper does not appear to be much
of a threat at first, but the look of swift cunning in its glowing red
eyes betrays its ferocity.  Equipped with a pouch of tofu chunks, it
is certainly a foe to be reckoned with.

The Tofurky of Death   54000
A towering mass of soy derivative stands before you.  The Tofurky of
Death pulses with evil and chaotic energies.  Spongy, bread-like, and
extremely lethal, the Tofurky of Death is not to be trifled with.

Soy Nut     481



A little cube of tofu
A small cube of firm tofu.  Packed with soy protein goodness, this
might make a tasty snack.

Tofu Armour
A large breastplate made from tofu.  It is squishy, yet firm.  It has
been imbued with mystical powers from the Para-Elemental Plane of Soy,
granting it an unnaturally effective strength.
