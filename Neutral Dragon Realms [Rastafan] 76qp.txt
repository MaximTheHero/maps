Deacern's Amulet
This is the amulet of the Titan God Deacern.  Only the mightiest of the
Titan warriors is ever granted the amulet.  Should the amulet ever fall
into the wrong hands, you can bet that Deacern will eventually come to
claim it, and the life of the thief that acquired it.
Bands of gold and platinum hold a wonderous gem in the center of this
amulet.  The gemstone is hard to identify, although it almost appears
as if some hybrid of the 4 precious stones: Emerald, Diamond, Ruby, and
Sapphire.  The stone almost seems alive, it pulses softly and the
colors shift and sway.  The necklace portion of the amulet is made
from a mystical leathery material so strong that the sharpest of
swords could not sever this cord.

The Famerian Hammer (enchanted)
This is an enormous hammer, with an 8' shaft and a head that must
weigh 300 pounds.  One side of the head is a flat, round surface for
pounding things smooth.  The other end is a curved spike for
separating things that are melded together.  The hammer is blue with
orange veins running through it.  The hammer is not well balanced for
wielding as a weapon, though it is likely a phenomenal tool for a
weapon smith, if said person could actually carry it.

MindBender (enchanted)
A very sinister looking dagger.  It shimmers and wavers from view,
quickly reappearing.  The blade seems to pulse, growing and shrinking,
metal blades extend and retract from the central blade.  Sharp iron spikes
line the hilt of this weapon, making wielding it a dangerous action.

Aura of Confidence
The aura shimmers translucently in the light, while nearly weightless
it exudes power and you feel compelled to wear it.
