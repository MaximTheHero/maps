An Executioner   27406
This is one of the people responsible for all those bones in the pit.
His job is to remove any armour and skin from its victim and place
the bones into the pit.  He is nothing but a small orc carrying his
most prized item, his executioner's axe.




An executioner's axe (enchanted)
The axe is four feet long with a thick wooden handle. The top
is made into two thick blades made for easy swinging. In the
right hands this weapon could do some good damage.
