Zelligar's Headband -=|[.oOo.]|=-
Deceptively light and not at all cumbersome, this headband is unlike any
standard headband one may come across.  It is vaguely elliptical, and its
combat face is covered with a deep, swirling, sparkly luminescence that seems
like viscous silver liquid.  It seems to be an illusion of magical origin,
although there are no other indications that this headband possesses magical
properties.
