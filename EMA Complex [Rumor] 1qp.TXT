EMA Worker   4438
This hard working employee looks haggard and broken down. His face is
drawn and pale, as if he hasn't seen much sleep recently. When he
looks at you, he does so without any recognition. He almost reminds
you more of a drone than a man.

EMA Guard   8447
This guy must weigh at least 240 pounds and towers over you.
Underneath his grey buzzcut hair are two green eyes that look very
cold and very untrusting. Thick muscles bulge under his navy blue
jacket and his mouth appears to be set in a permanent scowl.

EMA Scientist    6815
This rather scrawny man is one of the EMA's leading scientists.
Dedicated to improving the city of Atlanta's infrastructure, he works
on everything from high-tech sewage systems to deadly weapon
development. He stands about six foot two and wears a long white lab
coat over his brown slacks and white shirt. His blue eyes are
bloodshot, likely from a lack of sleep while he concentrates on
finding solutions to his latest project.

EMA Engineer   4643
This balding little man wears thick glasses and still seems to have
trouble seeing where he's going. He's probably spent too much time
studying his designs and computer read-outs. He wears black pants that
are a little too snug in the waist and a white button-down shirt
that's stretched tight over his middle-aged paunch. He looks
intelligent, but too busy to spend time with unwelcome visitors.

EMA Research Assistant   3095
This brainy-looking woman wears a long white lab coat over her red
blouse and tan slacks. The round glasses perched on the end of her
nose make her look studious, but don't hide her pretty brown eyes or
her youthful demeanor. She looks like she is engrossed in something
much more important than talking to the likes of you.

EMA Admin   9147
This busy admin takes care of the details for his boss's work
schedule. He seems agitated and doesn't look particularly friendly.
Might not be a good time to bother him.

EMA Agent   8221
This guy looks like he means business. Dressed in a dark suit,
muscular and wearing a semi automatic machine gun on his hip, he might
be one to leave alone. He looks up from his desk and glares at your
intrusion.

EMA Director   13028
The man himself, leader of the Agency. This tall, gaunt, dark featured
man stares at you with cold, calculating eyes. His mouth is curled
slightly in what might be a knowing smirk. Attacking a man of this
nature is probably a very bad idea.

EMA Mechanic   8084
This brawny fellow is one of the mechanics that maintain the vehicles
of the EMA. He's paid to service the machines, keeping them running
smoothly at all times. He's wearing a uniform that looks remarkably
clean considering his occupation. He probably just arrived to work not
long ago otherwise he'd be covered in grease. He looks like he's
pretty busy so you probably shouldn't bother him.

EMA Driver   5534
This large man is a driver for the EMA. Judging by the hard hat he is
wearing, he probably drives one of the agency's bigger vehicles. His
uniform is clean although a bit wrinkled. He could use a good haircut
and it doesn't look like he's shaved for a couple days. A work order
hangs out of his front pocket. The impatient look on his face suggests
he'd rather be out in the field than waiting here in the garage.

EMA Garage Foreman   10699
This heavyset man looks none-too-happy to see you in his office. His
hooded eyes glare at you in consternation and his thin lips are turned
down in a frown. He's wearing a white short-sleeved dress shirt and
navy slacks over his stout frame. He holds a thick clipboard in one
hand. Maybe you should leave him alone.



small passcard
This little passcard looks like it might provide entry to
somewhere if you knew the right door to try it on.

Delta Elite Machine Gun
This shiny semi automatic machine gun looks like it could put a decent
sized hole in something if given the opportunity. It has a stamped
marking on the butt that reads 'Property of EMA'.

Delta Clip
This clip looks like it would fit well into the proper automatic weapon.
A digital counter on the side displays the number "50"

EMA lab coat
This white lab coat is worn over the clothes and is
typically used by the scientists in Atlanta's Emergency
Management Agency. It doesn't look like it would offer
a great deal of protection, but it sure makes you look
brainy.

Armoured Vest
This thick black vest looks like it would provide good protection.
It is padded in front and back and seems to contain a heavy alloy
underneath the padding to absorb blows.

EMA uniform
This light blue uniform is worn as a coverall by
the mechanics that work in Atlanta's EMA Complex.
It isn't anything fancy, but it is made of a very
durable fabric that protects from basic garage
hazards.

EMA hard hat
This bright yellow protective headgear is worn by
the drivers that work in Atlanta's EMA Complex.
The hat is made of hard plastic and has the letters
'EMA' stenciled on the front in blue.

driving gloves
These soft leather gloves protect the hands of
truck drivers from blisters and calluses. Machine
stitched and extra durable, these gloves would
probably hold up well if taken care of.

a thick clipboard
This clipboard is made of red reinforced plastic.
Typically used to hold pieces of paper, it looks
like it might be sturdy and lightweight enough to
make a decent weapon too if one were to bash someone
over the head with it. You're much too civilized for
that type of behavior though, right?

screwdriver
This industrial strength screwdriver is used in the
EMA garage for fixing the agency's vehicles. It is
12 inches long with a hard plastic handle and a
flattened end for tightening screws. It looks like
it could also take a decent sized chunk out of
someone if used as a weapon.

socket wrench
This steel tool is typically used by mechanics to
fix things around their garage. Its handle is about
eight inches long and it has a socket attachment on
one end. Even if you're not handy with machinery, it
looks heavy enough to brain somebody with if you used
it as a weapon.

EMA Riot Shield
Only about half an inch thick, this polycarbonate
body shield still provides excellent protection to
the forces of Atlanta's Emergency Management Agency.
The shield measures about five feet tall and two feet
wide, large enough to protect the typical policeman,
although a bit small for some of the city's larger
cyber-enhanced soldiers. It has a rubberized handle
on the inside of the shield that allows a firm grip
and its surface is translucent to allow the wearer a
better view of his or her opponent.
