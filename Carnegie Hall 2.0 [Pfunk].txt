An Usher
This is one of the many ushers here at Carnegie Hall.  Most of them are music
students at Julliard or Manhattan School of Music.  He loves his job and is
prepared to do just about anything to keep you from sneaking in to hear the
performance.

A man in a hurry to find his seat
This audience member is rushing to get to his seat before the concert starts.
He is your typical New Yorker.

A bodyguard (ex-mafia)
This bodyguard was once a hitman for a prominent crime family.  The organized
crime rings of New York and New Jersey came under heavy investigation by the
FBI and he decided it was in his best interests to go to work for the feds.
After he helped put his mafia buddies in jail he got a job as bodyguard for
the Mayor of New York.  He is very intimidating. Are you sure you can take
him on and survive?

Michael Rudolph Guilioomberg (taking a dump)
This is Mayor Michael Rudolph Guilioomberg, the most popular mayor of New
York City since Jimmy Durante.  After a succession of increasingly corrupt
leaders, several of the city's megacorporations joined forces to create the
ultimate genetically perfect mayor and the country's first acknowledged
artificially generated politician. It looks like you caught him off guard.
You had better not harm the Mayor.  The city is the Mayor and the Mayor is
the city.

A Lady (waiting to use the toilet)
This Lady is waiting in line to use the restroom.  Like all New Yorkers, she
avoids eye contact and never smiles.  She is sneering at you while she chats
to her high society girlfriends.

A lady in a hurry to find her seat 
This audience member is rushing to get to her seat before the concert starts.
She is your typical New Yorker.

A sleeping audience member
This audience member is trying to get some rest in her seat here.  She is
quite elderly and you understand why she might easily doze off while
listening to the concert.
 
An angry audience member
This audience member is extremely agitated that you are disturbing him.  He
was just trying to enjoy the concert when you barged in.  He must have had a
rough week at his job.

A polite audience member
This audience member is enjoying the concert very much.  He sees you coming
down the row but acts like he doesn't notice you.

A Large Usher
This is one of the many ushers here at Carnegie Hall.  Most of them are music
students at Julliard or Manhattan School of Music.  He loves his job and is
prepared to do just about anything to keep you from sneaking in to hear the
performance.  He looks as if he has been working out!

Jay-Z
This is Howard Liebowitz, grand prize winner of the 89th annual
Weehawken Rap-O-Rama. His remarkable impersonation of the rapper Jay-Z
has become a thing of legend, and gets him invited to supermarket
openings, bar-mitzvahs and all manner of other a-list social events.

Beyonce
Mavis Rierson, Howard Liebowitz's long suffering fiancee, has apparently
agreed to yet again dress up as Beyonce Knowles to accompany him. She
evidently hasn't put in that much effort though. Her mousey hair is
escaping from under one side of a particularly unconvincing wig and her
bulging drum-tight lycra catsuit is probably creaking at the seams!

Mel Brooks
At first glance this looks like another bad impersonator of the
director, screenwriter, composer, lyricist, comedian, actor and producer
Mel Brooks. Looking closer you realize that this is actually HIM!
Apparently Mel made some astute investments in gerontology research
during his heyday, and thanks to some black market viral gene therapy he
is evidently still going strong over a hundred years later!

New York Chief of Police
You seem to have caught the Chief of Police doing things she really
shouldn't be doing with the New York Fire Chief, especially during a
concert! She is partially undressed, and trying to cover herself up to
preserve some shred of her dignity.

New York Fire Chief
You seem to have caught the Fire Chief doing things he really shouldn't
be doing with the New York Chief of Police, especially during a concert!
He is partially undressed, and trying to cover himself up to preserve
some shred of his dignity.

Trixie Hilton
Trixie Hilton is the latest in a long line of over-entitled, excessively
wealthy heiresses to the Hilton family fortune. She is immaculately
dressed in an outfit the size of a handkerchief, with a pair of the
latest nine inch designer stilettos on her recently pedicured feet. Over
one arm she has a large, very expensive handbag which seems to be
vibrating slightly and occasionally growling.

Bono
Bono (former identity redacted) is the current lead singer of U2.0, one
of the Megatech Corp "Reboot Bands"(tm). Megatech currently leases the
Bono persona to 17 separate commercial ventures, but this is currently
regarded as the most authentic reproduction.

The Edge
"The Edge"(c) is the lead guitarist of U2.0. His trademarked black
beanie hat (available at any good Megatech stockist) is as always jammed
firmly down on his head so you cannot see how bald he is going.

Larry Mullen Jr
Larry Mullen Jr is the drummer for the band U2.0. This happens to be the
fifth Larry the band has employed in the last 3 years, having lost the
previous four to a series of freak gardening accidents.

Adam Clayton
You are surprised to find out that Adam Clayton, the bass guitarist for
U2.0, is currently a woman. Apparently the Megatech marketing dept. has
currently decided to cast a woman in the role to monopolize on the "sexy
bassist" appeal for the mid-to-late teenage boy demographic.

Woody Allen
This is the infamous film director and comedian Woody Allen, who is
attending the concert tonight with his wife Soon-Yi. Well, to be more
precise, this is Woody Allen's reanimated preserved brain embedded
within a polycarbon steel cybernetic host body, attending the concert
tonight with his wife Soon-Yi.
Known for centuries as the king of autobiographical comedy, Woody is
normally a social recluse but occasionally you'll see him out and about.

Soon-Yi
This is Soon-Yi, Woody Allen's daughter / wife / bodyguard. She
appears to be in her mid forties, but you happen to know that she and
Woody began their relationship in the 1990s when she was 21. That
would now make her well over 150 years old! She is remarkably well
preserved for a woman of her age.

Billy Crystal

After Billy Crystal's death in the mid 21st Century in the middle of
hosting his 19th consecutive live Oscar ceremony, the New York Yankees
bought the merchandising rights to his image to use as their mascot. The
animatronic marvel you see before you is the result of years of
subsequent research and development.
Unfortunately for the Yankees, Animatronic Billy became sentient during
his first game after being hit by a flying hotdog, escaped and has
resisted all attempts at recapture.





X53.6 high-voltage taser baton (enchanted)
This is a civilian issue X53.6 collapsible high-voltage auto recharge taser
baton. Designed to cause neuromuscular incapacitation (and associated
debilitating pain), it is technically regarded as a non-lethal weapon. Anyone
who has been on the receiving end of one of these vicious little glorified
cattle prods would probably be inclined to disagree.

A bottle of pepper spray

This is a caustic bottle of pepper spray, mainly used for protection or defense.
The police strongly recommend that people who are going to be out after dark own
a few of these.
The bottle is completely full of pepper spray!

An expensive pearl necklace
This is a very expensive necklace with six strings of perfect large white
pearls. The irridescent pearls seem to shimmer in the light, reflecting back
hints of yellow and green.

An expensive diamond ring
This is a very expensive white gold ring with six diamonds embedded into the
middle of the band which throw out sparkles of red and blue.

An expensive wool skirt
This is a very well tailored knee length skirt made from the finest quality
Merino wool, with six pleats at the hemline. A slit in the side of the skirt
reveals a blue silk lining hand stitched with pink thread.

An expensive pair of stilettos
This is a very expensive pair of patent leather stilettos with pink and purple
stitching and a six inch spike heel.

An expensive pair of suit pants
This is a very well tailored pair of black suit pants made from the finest
quality Merino wool, with a thirty-six inch waistband. The aqua and dark green
designer label seems to have been torn at some point, it is now unreadable.

An expensive mens wristwatch
This is a very expensive gold wristwatch with six different dials set into the
black ceramic face. The hour hand has been accented with a line of blue and a
touch of pink helps the minute hand to stand out.
The time is currently one twenty-five am.

An expensive titanium ring
This is a very expensive titanium ring with six gold bands running around it. An
unusual pink lustre to the gold is offset nicely by the slightly red sheen of
the titanium.

An expensive pair of loafers
This is a very expensive pair of patent leather shoes, hand stitched in blue and
yellow, each one adorned with six gold trimmed tassles.

An expensive suitcoat
This is a very expensive six button jacket with a yellow and green silk lining.
Somebody must have paid an arm for this thing.

A shiny titanium roboglove
This is a highly polished articulated metal glove constructed from tiny panels
of thin titanium. On the back of the hand is an abstract scroll pattern of seven
gold wires surrounding a bold tribal design in purple and yellow enamel.

A black onyx ring
This ring is a thin titanium band with a pure black polished onyx gemstone set
into it. Mounted on the face of the gem is a letter S in platinum highlighted
with seven tiny diamonds which throw out sparkles of pink and aqua.

A large red fireaxe (enchanted)
This is a well used, well cared for firefighter's axe. The steel head of the axe
has a wide razor-sharp blade on one end, balanced by a tapered seven inch pick
on the other. The red enameled head is mounted firmly onto an elegantly curved
hickory wood shaft which is shaped perfectly for a one or two handed grip,
although it is likely to be more effective held with two hands. When you touch
the axehead, the heat seems to be rapidly drawn from your hand into the steel!

A seven chain diamond necklace
This stunning necklace has seven delicate gold chains with ten colored teardrop
shaped diamonds. The clasp of the necklace appears to contain a very densely
packed electronic device of some kind.
The black diamond is glowing steadily. The white, blue, yellow, pink and aqua
diamonds are glowing dimly. The purple diamond is glowing faintly.

a pair of purple shades
These purple wrap-around shades are huge, and make you look like a fly when you
have them on! Thick aqua and pink composite plastic arms help hold the oversized
sunglasses to your face.
