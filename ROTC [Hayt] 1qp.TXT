1: Captain Pope
   search desk - Khaki marble



Captain Pope    72979
From boots to hat this man looks like he was a born
leader.  His brown eyes meet your stare and he smirks at you.
As he shifts some papers around you notice his large muscles
and decide that leaving him alone may be the healthiest choice.
He is dressed perfectly; from head to toe you note nothing
wrong.  His boots look freshly polished, and he looks like he
is ready for anything.

Captain Meyer    41749
Captain Meyer looks intent on ignoring you for the
moment.  He reads quickly through his papers and his bright
eyes flash up momentarily.  He looks very intelligent, but he
is being quite reserved.  His black hair mixed with his stoney
facial features make him slightly intimidating.  As his eyes
pass over you again you realize that you should not even think
of upsetting him.  There is something about him that bothers you.

Admiral Rogers (deadly)    78333
This man is short, and you feel like laughing at him,
but he has an air about him that makes you hold your tongue.
His eyes meet your look coldly, you can see no hint of
emotion in them.  As he moves about the room you see his
muscles bulge beneath his battle dress uniform.  He is a Navy
SEAL on special training.  It would be wise to keep your
distance from him; he looks dangerous.

Captain Truebenbach    72434
This is one big man.  Intimidating is the first word
to come to your mind.  He is clearly too large for his battle
dress uniform.  In fact, he is so large it is scary.  Just a
quick glimpse tells you that he is very strong.  He is dressed
neatly in his army gear, though he is not wearing a hat.  His
blonde hair is cut very short and his steel blue eyes pierce
into you and you begin to worry about your future.

Sergeant Stark   17861
The Sergeant stands between you and the strange device.
You have a feeling he won't let you get anywhere near it.  He
looks very professional, yet relaxed.  There is something that
you fear in his casual presence.  His boots have been recently
polished, and you are surprised that he looks this clean for
being in the closet room with all of the supplies.  To check
out what is behind him, you must kill him.

A Navy SEAL pin
A gold Navy SEAL pin! This is the symbol of the SEAL's first
kill, and is usually stabbed into the chest. Maybe wearing it
will bring you some of the courage of a real Navy SEAL...but
are you worthy?

Cased Mirror
This round, hinged case of ivory spans the length of your hand, and
can be opened up to reveal two warped mirrors of grozed glass. What
you determine to be the top has been carved in intricate detail; a
depiction of a man and a woman on horseback, a hawk on the man's
gloved arm. On the bottom is a short inscription: 'To my beloved
daughter'.
