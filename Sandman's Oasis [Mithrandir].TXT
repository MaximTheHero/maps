A Sandman riding a Furry Animal   17565
This is Thaigan the sandman riding a strange animal. In his left hand
he is holding what seems to be a glass crystal. The crystal shines
brightly in the hot desert sun and the sunrays concentrate around the
strange object. In his right hand he is holding a rope that is tied
around the neck of a fearful creature. The enormous animal serves as a
transportation vehicle for the sandmen and it has been trained to serve
and obey everything its master commands. It is said that the sandmen earn
their living by searching out the deserts for strange objects which they sell
to mad scientists to help them in their wicked projects. The sandman speaks
to himself. Maybe you should listen to him, it might be interesting.


A small crystal
A small crystal. It shines with a power of its own. The light
fades from blue to green. A strange forcefield surrounds the
crystal and you aren't sure what would happen if you held the
strange object in your hands.
hold crystal
A strange feeling of protection hits you as you grab the crystal
and close your hand around it. A thin energy field surrounds
you and makes your skin emit a faint blue light. You suddenly
feel more protected.
