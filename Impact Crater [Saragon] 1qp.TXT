Chondrite Marble

A small piece of chondrite
This small piece of chondrite was once a much larger meteor.  Where
this rock came from you can only wonder, but from the history of the
area it can be guessed that this might have come from one of the
orbital mass drivers used in the last war.  A cleaner solution than
nuclear weapons, their power was still very destructive.  You would
have to get this sample analyzed in order to determine its exact
origin.
