something about main room.  Sossymator 3000
looks like you can make sausage.  the meat won't fit...


P.J. Kludgenstone, the frankfurter tycoon  - unkillable
P.J. Kludgenstone is a large man, grown fat on the profits of his
frankfurter business.  Well, grown fat on the frankfurters of his
frankfurter business at any rate.  He now constantly smells of
sausage, and is the best friend of many a stray doggy when he leaves
his office.  His love of the frankfurter is so great, he requested his
new office be constructed entirely of them, which does mean it needs
completely rebuilding every few days before it starts to go all
stinky.

A Carcass (huge) (frozen)    2534

The carcass of some unkown beast, come to life with seemingly the sole
purpose of making you one of its kin.  Oh dear.  It is a repulsive
hunk of flesh, devoid of all skin, and yet somehow it contains a
rudimentary intelligence.  It's probably best if you kill it.  Now.

Meat Man   5707
This man-shaped meaty monstrosity is hideous!  Bits of carcass and
flesh are seemingly thrown together in no particular order, creating
by chance a disgusting beast looking something like a man.  The
pungent smell of fresh blood wafts into your face as the meat man
moves nearer, its eyeless face searching, searching, searching.  What
you wouldn't give right now for a nice big BBQ.

>(  )-(  )-(  )-(  )-(  )-(  )<   2758
A vicious string of sausages, trying to tangle and strangle you!  Each
individual sausage is trying to thump you on the head, making for a
wiggly-squiggly mass of dangerous meaty-treats!

>(  SERGEANT SAUSAGE  )<    5631
Sergeant Sausage is pissed because somebody has been killing all his
strings of recruits.  He wears a gleaming row of medals proudly, all
earned in combat, all of them well deserved.  If you don't think you
can take a big military-meat-man like sarge here, you're in a whole
lot of trouble.




A wiggly piece of meat
Eww, a raw piece of meat that wiggles strangely, all by itself!
Though it is raw and fresh, there is no blood coming from it, though
it does have a rich, deep, red colour.  You wonder if it is safe to
eat wiggling meat.

A sachet of powdered vanilla
A small clear and silver sachet, containing powdered vanilla.  There
are no markings or writing on it at all, but there looks like enough
to add flavour to a small meal.  It smells quite tasty, though it has
a bit of grease on the outside of the packet.

A sachet of powdered horseradish
A small clear and silver sachet, containing powdered horseradish.
There are no markings or writing on it at all, but there looks like
enough to add flavour to a small meal.  It smells quite tasty, though
it has a bit of grease on the outside of the packet.

A sachet of powdered cabbage
A small clear and silver sachet, containing powdered cabbage.  There
are no markings or writing on it at all, but there looks like enough
to add flavour to a small meal.  It smells quite tasty, though it has
a bit of grease on the outside of the packet.

A sachet of powdered coffee
A small clear and silver sachet, containing powdered coffee.  There
are no markings or writing on it at all, but there looks like enough
to add flavour to a small meal.  It smells quite tasty, though it has
a bit of grease on the outside of the packet.

A sachet of powdered beer
A small clear and silver sachet, containing powdered beer.  There are
no markings or writing on it at all, but there looks like enough to
add flavour to a small meal.  It smells quite tasty, though it has a
bit of grease on the outside of the packet.

A sachet of powdered paprika
A small clear and silver sachet, containing powdered paprika.  There
are no markings or writing on it at all, but there looks like enough
to add flavour to a small meal.  It smells quite tasty, though it has
a bit of grease on the outside of the packet.

are no markings or writing on it at all, but there looks like enough
to add flavour to a small meal.  It smells quite tasty, though it has
a bit of grease on the outside of the packet.

A Row of Sausage-Skin Medals
What a nice row of medals, just right to pin upon your chest and feel
like a big wartime hero, pity that they are made from dried
sausage-skin.  Even if you killed the rightful owner to get them,
that's what war is all about, right?





The following items can be examined in this room: 
room
Absolutely everything in the office is made of franks!  How very tasty.  Even
the floor is lined with slab-sized sausages which tend to squish and ooze a
little under your feet.

slices
From what you can see, the pages of the book are finely sliced and dried pieces
of sausage meat.  You wonder what is written on them.

top of desk
Nope, still empty.

legs
The legs are thin frankfurters, hardly up to the job of supporting anybody who
sits in the chair.  They look like they would wibble and wobble all over the
place.

supporting frankfurters
Large, supporting frankfurters make up the doorway through which you can exit.

frankfurter skin
Eeeewwwwwww!

doorway
Large, supporting frankfurters make up the doorway through which you can exit.

spiral
Around and around and around and around go the little frankfurters.  You start
getting queasy, and realize you don't really want to stare at the spiral any
more.

rug
A particularly disturbing rug (in the loose sense of the word of course, as much
as it can be a rug when it is made out of long thin sausages woven together)
lies in the centre of the floor.  The pattern is an ever-decreasing spiral that
seems to move and swirl as you look at it.  Spooky.

large desk
Constructed from finely-grained frankfurters, P.J. Kludgenstone's desk is a
remarkable piece of work (or is that cookery?).  The top is completely empty,
giving the impression that whatever it is that goes on here, there isn't any of
it going on at the moment.  Behind the desk is a solid-looking chair.

<super hidden>, 

chair legs
The legs are thin frankfurters, hardly up to the job of supporting anybody who
sits in the chair.  They look like they would wibble and wobble all over the
place.

boards
The frankfurters making up the floor are long and thin, and trampled almost flat
so that at first glance they appear to be normal floorboards.  Normal
floorboards don't ooze and squish like that though.  There is a disturbing rug
in the centre of the floor.

skin
Eeeewwwwwww!

book
The book on the top shelf looks to have a cover made from peeled frankfurter
skin, and the pages are wafer-thin slices of sausage meat.  The whole thing has
a strangely disturbing air, making you shy away from trying to read it.

centre
A particularly disturbing rug (in the loose sense of the word of course, as much
as it can be a rug when it is made out of long thin sausages woven together)
lies in the centre of the floor.  The pattern is an ever-decreasing spiral that
seems to move and swirl as you look at it.  Spooky.

bookcase
The formidable frankfurter bookshelf stands behind the desk and chair.  It is
almost completely empty, except for that one book at the very top.

The following items can be searched in this room: 
frankfurters
Searching around the frankfurters makes you hungry.  Mmmmm, a nice big
boiled frankfurter, swimming in rich tomato sauce and rolled up in a
thick slice of fresh bread.

floor
Examining the floorboards more closely lets you see that they are in
fact specially made flat frankfurters, not just normal franks that have
been squashed flat.  What lengths a slightly-loopy frankfurter tycoon
will go to for his fantasy office.

Whoah!  Those frankfurters supporting the door are pretty big, they
could almost qualify as the fabled "Biggest Frankfurter in the World!",
but not quite.
