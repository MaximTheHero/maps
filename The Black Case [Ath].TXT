Miss Brown
Miss Brown is in her mid thirties and hums quietly to herself. She
looks willing to teach you some clarinet basics if you talk to her.



tally ho
The cigarette paper has a tiny corner cut off one of the edges, is
very thin and has a line of glue along one edge. The paper is highly
absorbent and can be used to absorb the moisture off the tiny corks
underneath the clarinet keys. Keeping the corks clean helps them to
last longer.

cork grease
Fifteen ounces of premium cork grease is in a chapstick style tube.
Opening the lid, you see the grease is pure white and feels smooth to
the touch. The grease is used to keep the corks between the clarinet
sections from sticking. It is not pretty, but is very important if you
want your clarinet corks to last.

clarinet reed
The clarinet reed is one centimeter by four centimeters long. One end
of the reed tapers off to a thin edge. This end has to be sheer enough
to vibrate quickly to produce the sound. The other end is slightly
thicker, allowing it to be attached to the mouth piece of the clarinet
without breaking. Long unused, dust and speckles of yellowish mould
cover the reed.

old rag
A square, off-white rag with a blue and red strip around the edge. The
base colour of the rag used to be white but has yellowed over the
years of being used to clean the inside of the clarinet. The rag is
attached to a two foot long weighted rope which is used to draw the
rag through the clarinet. You vaguely wonder why the rag was being
used to clean the stars.
