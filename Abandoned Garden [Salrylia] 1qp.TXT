1: Hacketoff's Bridge [Stelari]
2: search dirt - Ultramarine Marble



a tiny faerie, fluttering above your head    177
Her tiny wings sparkling in her own light, this faerie wears a tiny, but
nevertheless exquisitely made gown of a deep burgandy gossamer. Her eyes
twinkle with merriment as she smiles at you.

A glossy blue-black bower bird, hovering protectively    92
His feathers a deep shiny bluish black colour, he has beady black eyes,
rimmed with a bright yellow, and a sharp long beak.




a tiny golden bow
A tiny golden bow, with magical arrows that have the power to make
unsuspecting mortals fall hopelessly in love with each other.
It has 4 arrows left in the quiver.

a tiny silver necklace
Far too small for you to wear, this looks like it might belong to one of
the little people.

Ultramarine Marble
Exquisitely crafted/magicked, this pristine little ultramarine bauble is
the whimsical, residual aftermath of peeronic thought.  Sadly, the
entropic tendencies of such mental energies are difficult to grasp or
maintain.  A marble will inevitably evanesce and reform in an infinite
number of cryptic locations.

a slender long stemmed rose
A long stemmed red rose in full bloom, droplets of morning dew still nestling
in amongst its petals, its tiny thorns barely able to tickle your skin.
There is a card attached to the stem by a silver ribbon.

a bold bright sunflower
Large golden leaves splay out from the deep brown core of the sunflower, and
its huge strong stem is slightly rough against your hands.
There is a card attached to the stem by a silver ribbon.

a fragile violet
Tiny sparkles of purple, gold and a touch of white form into a violet,
its fragile stem barely able to hold the weight, it moves gently in the
breeze.
There is a card attached to the stem by a silver ribbon.
