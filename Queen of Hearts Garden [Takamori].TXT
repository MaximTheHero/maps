The Queen of Hearts   1822
The Queen of Hearts.  This is her garden.  She seems really grumpy and
is complaining about all sorts of non-existent flaws in her garden.
Be careful messing with her.

The 6 of Hearts   384
A gigantic playing card is standing here!  It is apparently wandering
through the Queen's garden.  It has 6 hearts emblazoned on its chest.

A Gardener   149
A little man in overalls.  He is hard at work.  He is futilely
attempting to fix every flaw in the garden before the Queen can
possibly imagine one.  He is dressed in brown overalls and has a
gardening tool in his hand.


Gardening Hoe
A standard gardening hoe.  It has a six foot long wooden handle with a
metal spade on one end.  The wood is worn down from use. It would be
unwieldy, but you could probably cause some damage with it.
