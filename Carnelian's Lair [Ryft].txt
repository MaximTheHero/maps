A glow surrounds the corpse of Carnelian.

You recognize the form of the Keeper at Land's End in the aura!

The Keeper says: I am sorry for attacking you, but I thought
you were here to steal the source, but alas, now I am dead, and
the real Carnelian is free to take the source. But
before I pass to the next world, I must tell you of
Carnelian's plot and deception.

The Keeper says: Carnelian is not only a bugblatter beast but
also a powerful illusionist. He lives only to cause
misery in other people's lives. To destroy the source
would have killed many innocent people and hurt their
families and friends. Carnelian would have liked that.

The Keeper says: When I learned of this plot, I took the source
from the lamp to hide it from Carnelian, knowing that it would
endanger the lives of many, but also knowing that if
the source was lost, that the lives of many more
would be lost.

The Keeper says: Carnelian, enraged at my stealth, cast forth a powerful
enchantment that sought my person and changed my appearance.
He then took on my likeness to deceive those around me and to
gain control over the source. My whereabouts, however remained
hidden from him. You must return the source to the lamp
or many more innocent people will be killed.

The Keeper says: But remember, brave one, that should the
source fall into Carnelian's hands, the lives of thousands will
be at Carnelian's mercy.

The Keeper says: There is one last thing.

The Keeper says: In my haste, I forgot to bring
the Sphere of the Keeper. Carnelian has it now, and it
possesses much power. You must be wary, for he is
a truly evil opponent, and will stop at nothing to
satisfy his hunger for misery.

The aura brightens.

The Keeper says: Remember brave one, be wary!
With a flash of light, the Keeper disappears.
