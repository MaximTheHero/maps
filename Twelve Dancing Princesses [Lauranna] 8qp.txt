An old woman.

The old woman wears a plain brown dress with plain brown shoes. She
has a wrinkled face and her hair is hidden under a white kerchief. Her
back is bent slightly with age, although she seems to walk pretty well
for her age.

You say: hi
Old Woman says: You look new to this place.  Have you heard the
                King's proclamation?
You say: king
Old Woman says: Oh, the King is a very nice old fellow.  You
                should go up to the castle and say hello.  I think
                he'd like you.

You say: proclamation
Old Woman says: The King says that whoever can discover
                where his twelve daughters go every night dancing,
                even though he locks them in their room, can choose
                one of them as a spouse and get half the kingdom.
                But you only have three days, to discover where they
                go or you'll be banished from the kingdom for the rest
                of your life.  I can explain how to get past the
                defenses of the Princesses.

You say: princesses
Old Woman says: Yes, they're very beautiful.  I was their nurse
                when they all were younger.  I'd like to see them
                all get married and settle down.

You say: defenses
Old Woman says: That really is not so difficult.  Do not drink the
                wine which is brought to you before you retire in
                the evening, but nonetheless, you must pretend
                that you have fallen asleep.  Simply pour the wine
                down your neck when it is brought to you.  Wear
                this cloak and you will be invisible, in order
                that you might follow the Princesses where they
                go.

Old Woman says: If for some reason you cannot wear the cloak, try
                some other means of becoming invisible.

Old woman gives you a cloak.

A noble king.

Wise, intelligent eyes study you from this aged man.  White waves
of hair flow from under the crown on his head.  His beard and
mustache are neatly trimmed on his friendly face.  He wears richly
colored fabrics in fashionable designs.  You are warmed by his smile.

You say: hi
The King says: Welcome to my lands.  Have you come about the
               proclamation?

You say: proclamation
The King says: Whoever can discover where my twelve daughters go
               to dance every night, though they are locked in their
               chamber, may choose one of the Princesses as a spouse
               and inherit half the kingdom.  But if, after three
               days, whoever should try failed to discover where they
               did their night's dancing, they would be banished from
               the kingdom for the rest of their days.  You should find
               proof of where they've been as well as the path they
               took.

You say: token
The King says: Wonderful!  I'm glad you will take up this great
               challenge.  Your room is off in the west wing, guarding
               the entrance to the Princess' room.  On the morning of
               the third day, come back here with your proof of where
               they have been.  Here is a gemstone to keep track of
               your time.  Good luck!

The King gives you a gemstone.
