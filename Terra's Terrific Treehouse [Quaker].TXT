1: Bow - to go south
2: plant hammer
   Raising the hammer over your head you stab it into the ground!
   As one does with hammers.
   A spray of soft earth flies everywhere!  Where did that come from?
   After a moment, vines and branches writhe from the ground and consume the hammer.
   Through what must be the power of chaos, you've grown a tree!
   It stands there in its colorful glory, hoping that no one will chop it down.
chop tree (need an ax)
   You chop furiously with your axe until the top part falls with a crash.
   Chips of wood and <seed colored> leaves fly everywhere!
whittle ring
   You whittle furiously with your axe until the ring you envision takes shape.
   Chips of wood and <seed colored> bark fly everywhere!

*need to 'insert' 2 seeds into hammer
   

A Root Warrior
A creature of roots. It could be considered a warrior. It is mad that
you have been stepping on it and seeks revenge!

An Earthen Spirit
A spirit of the earth. Its corporeal form is lacking, but it looks as
if it could still hurt you! Then again, it also looks like you could
still hurt it.

Tree Guardian
A guardian of the trees. It isn't quite as big as the tree you're
walking through, but it still looks quite powerful.

Minor Earth Elemental
A minor earth elemental. It is made of rock, and it looks as if it
could easily crush you. Fear the power!

A Guardian Branch
An animated branch. It may not be very good at attacking, but it is
definitely strong.

Earth Elemental 
An earth elemental. It is made of rock and parts of the tree. It is
stronger than its smaller counterpart.

Earth Elemental Lord
A lord of earth. It is formed from all that is around it, and it fears
nothing. It looks at you with hatred, and you wonder why it does not
attack you.

Terra, Knight of Earth
A vision of beauty, Terra is the unrivaled Master of the element of
Earth. It is hers to command. She looks at you with a smile, knowing
that you have proven yourself worthy of fighting her.


A strangely dense wooden hammer (enchanted)
This two handed battle hammer is made of some kind of dense wood shaped without any
tool markings.  The markings on the hammer make it appear somewhat tree-like. There
are two openings in the head of the hammer it looks like you could insert something
in.  They look a little like fruit hanging from the branches of this tree-hammer.

A gigantic white seed - SMD
A gigantic white seed. It came from a giant piece of fruit. The tree it came from was
the size of a city, so it is fairly puny by those standards. It might grow if you
planted it in the right soil.

A gigantic blue seed - SP Regen
A gigantic blue seed. It came from a giant piece of fruit. The tree it came from was
the size of a city, so it is fairly puny by those standards. It might grow if you
planted it in the right soil.

A gigantic red seed - HP Regen
A gigantic red seed. It came from a giant piece of fruit. The tree it came from was
the size of a city, so it is fairly puny by those standards. It might grow if you
planted it in the right soil.

A gigantic green seed - AC
A gigantic green seed. It came from a giant piece of fruit. The tree it came from was
the size of a city, so it is fairly puny by those standards. It might grow if you
planted it in the right soil.

A <seed colored> tree
Through what must be the power of chaos, you've grown a very blue tree! It stands
there in its colorful glory, hoping that no one will cut it down.

A <seed colored> tree stump
Through what must be the power of chaos, you've grown a very blue tree! Well, you did,
but them some horrible monster chopped it down.  All that is left is a stump showing
way too many tree rings for how long the tree took to grow.

An iridescent piece of bark
This iridescent piece of bark came from a baby chaos tree someone
viciously cut down. What a monster! It was happy in the ground.

A strangely dense, very blue wooden ring {radiant} [.*-*-*-*-*.]
This ring is made of unadorned <seed colored> wood.  Blazing motes of <seed colored> light shift and
sparkle around the ring in hypnotic patterns.  It is surprisingly heavy and pulses
with vitality.
